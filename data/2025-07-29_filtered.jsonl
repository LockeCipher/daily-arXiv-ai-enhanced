In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency."}

However, little attention has been given to the immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next, we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally, to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries, architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing."}

Critically, ChoreoMuse supports style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the input music.

To address this, we introduce a neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using significantly fewer primitives."}

While existing methods focus on detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR."}

However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer computational resources.   This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands. We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage these properties to better distill model knowledge.   These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to become smaller, faster, and cheaper."}

To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network."}

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability. To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset, KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization setting with unseen ID categories.

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released."}

Each task involves distinct degradations, leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks.

Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore, we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors, from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without deviating from its generalist architecture."}

To tackle these challenges, we propose MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically, MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels.

Building upon this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space, promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance."}

However, one critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\\times$ downsampling) in the SD model. One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion; however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the 8$\\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\\times$ one while adapting to the pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\\times$ decoder based on the output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\\times$ encoder while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion, perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading, reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and 2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for realistic and consistent video editing.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP, sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art based on general-purpose pre-training.

To bridge this gap, We propose the MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the benchmarks it includes.

In this paper, we introduce SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B."}

Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding. Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For registration, it achieves a 41.9\\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB, highlighting superior structural preservation.

Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct generation.

T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%.

However, they fail to achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution. Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient and high-quality image restoration."}

One drawback of QBE searches is that they require sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE, which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents. Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at utilizing T2I generation for DIR."}

Recent state-of-the-art methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces, significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently, we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various ablation studies to validate our contributions."}

Existing methods inadequately utilize temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method."}

Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences."}

Deep learning integration into structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO, CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias (spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention, resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves, particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture and function."}

However, little attention has been given to the immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next, we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally, to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries, architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing."}

Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of creative applications.

Current CL methods function within the confines of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA, we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment."}

These attacks, involving hidden triggers, aim to cause the models to misclassify instances of the victim class as the target class when triggers are present, posing serious threats to the reliability of these models. To further explore the field of backdoor attacks against semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective backdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg leverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models to enhance backdoor performance. Our method is motivated by an intriguing observation, i.e., when the target class is set as the `co-occurring' class of the victim class, the victim class can be more easily `mis-segmented'. Building upon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class and rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship between the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier. Our experiments reveal that ConSeg achieves improvements in Attack Success Rate (ASR) with increases of 15.55\\%, compared to existing methods, while exhibiting resilience against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses."}

This approach augments training datasets for classification and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU.

To address this, we introduce a neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using significantly fewer primitives."}

In this paper, we present a novel neural network design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the pushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by line in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit previously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and computational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the ability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one, on low-power hardware.

This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs. Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation."}
