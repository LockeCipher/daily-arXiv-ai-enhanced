Using a simple sequence concatenation approach, FLUX.1 Kontext handles both local editing and generative in-context tasks within a single unified architecture. Compared to current editing models that exhibit degradation in character consistency and stability across multiple turns, we observe that FLUX.1 Kontext improved preservation of objects and characters, leading to greater robustness in iterative workflows.The model achieves competitive performance with current state-of-the-art systems while delivering significantly faster generation times, enabling interactive applications and rapid prototyping workflows. To validate these improvements, we introduce KontextBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 1026 image-prompt pairs covering five task categories: local editing, global editing, character reference, style reference and text editing.

Contemporary methods typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal. In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization. Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method, highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness."}

We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques.

To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity. Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions, SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent fine-grained conditions (\\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3) Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion Model to guide video generation.

To address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)** technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**, achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to **2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup."}

In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement. FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward pass.

This study closes this gap by systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask semantics.

In this paper, we propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep) model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction (i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization.

To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models, diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention (NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer, forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at https://github.com/WeinanGuan/NASA-Swin."}

This paper proposes an image fusion method based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs, and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics, producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich information without the necessity for a training dataset."}

The latest models can produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and data will be made publicly available."}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding, referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception and generative capabilities."}

Extracting and modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs."}

Recent attempts train VLMs to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation."}

DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models. Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos without additional training.

The method navigates the latent space of a diffusion model using a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), governed by balancing a classifier-informed boundary drive with a manifold constraint. The resulting counterfactuals are then used within a self-corrective learning strategy to improve the classifier by focusing on its specific areas of uncertainty.

Previous strategies, in particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal. In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction phase.

However, prior studies have mostly targeted task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature coding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example, features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate our approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines.

In this paper, we propose the first single step diffusion model for image compression (DiffO) that delivers high perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra low bitrates. DiffO achieves these goals by coupling two key innovations: (i) VQ Residual training, which factorizes a structural base code and a learned residual in latent space, capturing both global geometry and high frequency details; and (ii) rate adaptive noise modulation, which tunes denoising strength on the fly to match the desired bitrate.

This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition to guide the iterative refinement process using learned prior. Experimental results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PJDM."}

This study introduces a physically guided neural framework that unifies temperature correction and image enhancement through a symmetric skip-CNN architecture and an emissivity-aware attention module. The pre-processing stage segments the ROIs of the image and and initially corrected the firing rate. A novel dual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between the target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram matching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically fusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the industrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network realizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial background, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions."}

Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis."}

While such models are widely adopted, there is a limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2 ViT-S/14 and the Fr\\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image for \"United States\" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states and smaller cities. {\\color{black} In addition, we found that models systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding names like Frankfort or Devon."}

However, for adaptation in clinical practice, their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner, hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards better mitigating data biases with generative models."}

This study explores how different ratios of GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN. The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching 95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined. This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases."}

Existing methods leverage rich image priors from pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design, we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D scene generation."}
