However, current multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\\footnote{The source code of this work will be publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to high-dimensional multimodal data.

The two tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of 3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions, while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types.

A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling. This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity without increasing computational complexity.

However, interpreting time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser, a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural evolutions across time.

Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u540c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u5185\u5728\u573a\u666f\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u5206\u5272\u56fe\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e95\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5185\u5728\u573a\u666f\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDMs\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53bb\u566a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5185\u5728\u57df\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7ea0\u6b63\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Stable Diffusion\uff09\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u540c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9690\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u573a\u666f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning, we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt. Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification performance.

Most of the existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial continuity of Mamba.

We propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors, ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics along a direct path using a consistency model.

To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric regularization at object boundaries.

However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset. First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed method.

However, current methods frequently produce videos with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads. HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM).

However, vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive.

The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification. We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset, we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face, which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure no identity leakage. Our method achieves \\textbf{1st place} in the competition, and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales.

However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently, T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time (TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u8de8TE\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u80ce\u513f\u8111MRI\u4e2d\u7684T2\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u80ce\u513f\u8111MRI\u4e2d\u7684T2\u6620\u5c04\u57280.55T\u4e2d\u573a\u5f3a\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u957f\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u8de8TE\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301T2\u5b9a\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u80ce\u513f\u8111\u548c\u6210\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u57280.55T\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d3b\u4f53\u80ce\u513fT2\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89e3\u5256\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u51cf\u5c11\u6bcf\u4e2aTE\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5806\u6808\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

It requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive. Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization. This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model.

To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network (MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively.

However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution.

While autoregressive generative models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook, which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance. Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDCPE\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3k-means\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u7d22\u5f15\u503c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u3002k-means\u805a\u7c7b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u8d28\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDCPE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u66ff\u4ee3\u8d28\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51dd\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "DCPE\u5728LlamaGen-B\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec342%\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86FID\u548cIS\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DCPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR image.

PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize \"good data\" from existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation quality of advanced models.

However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO) framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image generation tasks.

In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform. This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches, striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail preservation.

For example, impervious surfaces heat up and speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\\geq 0.7\\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns from historical data that are significant for projecting future change. Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of different scenarios by means of driver variables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff08GenAI\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u53d8\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u900f\u6c34\u8868\u9762\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u53d8\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5341\u5e74\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u6c34\u8868\u9762\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u533a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u22650.7\u00d70.7km\u00b2\u65f6\uff0cMAE\u4f4e\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u6574\u5408\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u53d8\u91cf\u3002"}}
