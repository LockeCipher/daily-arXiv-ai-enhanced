To appear at ICIP 2025", "summary": "In recent years, neural rendering methods such as NeRFs and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, they heavily rely on preprocessed camera poses and 3D structural priors from structure-from-motion (SfM), which are challenging to obtain in outdoor scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose to incorporate Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with optimization-based refinement to achieve accurate camera pose estimation under large camera movements. Additionally, we introduce a voxel-based scene densification approach to guide the reconstruction in large-scale scenes.

In this work we adopt a strategy of point cloud decoupling and joint optimization to achieve the decoupled reconstruction of backgrounds and human bodies while preserving the interactivity of human motion. We introduce a position texture to subdivide the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) body model's surface and grow the human point cloud. To capture fine details of human dynamics and deformations, we incorporate a convolutional neural network structure to predict human body point cloud features based on texture. This strategy makes our approach free of hyperparameter tuning for densification and efficiently represents human points with half the point cloud of HUGS. This approach ensures high-quality human reconstruction and reduces GPU resource consumption during training. As a result, our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art HUGS in reconstruction metrics while maintaining the ability to generalize to novel poses and views. Furthermore, our technique achieves real-time rendering at over 100 FPS, $\\sim$6$\\times$ the HUGS speed using only Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) weights for human transformation. Additionally, this work demonstrates that this framework can be extended to animal scene reconstruction when an accurately-posed model of an animal is available."}

However, the intricate electromagnetic scattering mechanisms inherent to SAR imaging pose significant reconstruction challenges. Inspired by the remarkable success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) in optical domain reconstruction, this paper presents a novel SAR Differentiable Gaussian Splatting Rasterizer (SDGR) specifically designed for SAR target reconstruction. Our approach combines Gaussian splatting with the Mapping and Projection Algorithm to compute scattering intensities of Gaussian primitives and generate simulated SAR images through SDGR. Subsequently, the loss function between the rendered image and the ground truth image is computed to optimize the Gaussian primitive parameters representing the scene, while a custom CUDA gradient flow is employed to replace automatic differentiation for accelerated gradient computation. Through experiments involving the rendering of simplified architectural targets and SAR images of multiple vehicle targets, we validate the imaging rationality of SDGR on simulated SAR imagery. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method for target reconstruction is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets containing multiple vehicle targets, with quantitative evaluations conducted to assess its reconstruction performance. Experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively reconstruct the geometric structures and scattering properties of targets, thereby providing a novel solution for 3D reconstruction in the field of SAR imaging."}

However, these models still struggle with panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\\circ$ view. Unlike previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images."}

Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks, improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors, further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR. Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing general IR architectures."}

The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range."}

MESP emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks."}

TaleForge features three interconnected modules: Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene backdrops that incorporate personalized characters.

Traditionally, efforts have focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI. The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning, and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with similar content and structure from EEG data."}

To address these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks.

Recent works use video diffusion models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon, leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames, achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on long-horizon tasks."}

Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.

This paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and temporally for efficient latent space denoising.

Low-rank tensor representation has become essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability.

Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data.

Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions, underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the paper."}

In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals. Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs."}

In real-world applications, however, users often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

Github page: github.com/gudovskiy/odelt", "summary": "Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our $\\textrm{ODE}_t \\left(\\textrm{ODE}_l \\right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully reproducible experiments."}

Their inverse design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator, we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and datasets."}

Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering.

However, current approaches require a large number of denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity, as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are available at https://github.com/LuizScarlet/StableCodec."}

Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT) reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain. First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and generalization performance.

A common clinical approach mitigates this by sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane, use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at https://github.com/Yuliang-Huang/DIGS."}

Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data.

The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range."}
