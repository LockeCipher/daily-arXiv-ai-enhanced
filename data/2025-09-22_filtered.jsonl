We propose CausalStruct, a novel framework that embeds causal reasoning into 3D scene generation. Utilizing large language models (LLMs), We construct causal graphs where nodes represent objects and attributes, while edges encode causal dependencies and physical constraints. CausalStruct iteratively refines the scene layout by enforcing causal order to determine the placement order of objects and applies causal intervention to adjust the spatial configuration according to physics-driven constraints, ensuring consistency with textual descriptions and real-world dynamics. The refined scene causal graph informs subsequent optimization steps, employing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative(PID) controller to iteratively tune object scales and positions. Our method uses text or images to guide object placement and layout in 3D scenes, with 3D Gaussian Splatting and Score Distillation Sampling improving shape accuracy and rendering stability. Extensive experiments show that CausalStruct generates 3D scenes with enhanced logical coherence, realistic spatial interactions, and robust adaptability."}

Experimental techniques like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion, a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction. However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments."}

Current diffusion models can address the problem of correcting the timing of imprecisely timed poses, but we find that no good solution exists for leveraging the diffusion prior to enhance a sparse set of blocking poses with additional pose detail. We overcome this challenge using a simple inference-time trick. At certain diffusion steps, we blend the outputs of an unconditioned diffusion model with input blocking pose constraints using per-blocking-pose tolerance weights, and pass this result in as the input condition to an pre-existing motion retiming model. We find this approach works significantly better than existing approaches that attempt to add detail by blending model outputs or via expressing blocking pose constraints as guidance. The result is the first diffusion model that can robustly convert blocking-level poses into plausible detailed character animations."}

In this work, we investigate whether recently developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However, its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial."}

That is, solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN- and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images, achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%.

Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method.

MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.

Style mapping via reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black) when tested on Chicago Face Dataset.

Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition, which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically, low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal interaction at both local and global representations of image information. Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using 3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth estimations.

However, training large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU, leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity) improvement."}

In handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features. Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation.

Traditional methods like geometric algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise, limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts. Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering, followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy and complex settings.

However, existing SDS-based methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2) 2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.

Vision Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities, including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.

Despite significant advancements in VSR over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon two key insights: (i) learning an initial \\textit{coarse} alignment between visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content facilitates the subsequent learning of \\textit{precise} visual-to-speech mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions, refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced challenging Mandarin dataset."}

We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local details.

However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization, yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of 3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving."}

However, challenges still persist in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and contextually accurate images."}

A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image tokens into pixels.

Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process then performs \\textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling."}

This paper considers an alternative analysis formulation of PnP, in which the prior is imposed on a transformed representation of the image, such as its gradient. Specifically, we train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the gradient domain, rather than on the image itself. Conceptually, this is an extension of total variation (TV) regularization to learned TV regularization. To incorporate this gradient-domain prior in image reconstruction algorithms, we develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting (APnP-HQS) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM). We evaluate our approach on image deblurring and super-resolution, demonstrating that the analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain PnP algorithms."}

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10.
