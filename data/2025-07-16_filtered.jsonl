To address these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning. Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration (RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up, hair style).

Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods -- while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned medical image translation."}

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and real-time efficiency.

However, achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction (3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits. Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local 3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing."}

Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction. Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as text-to-image synthesis.

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments.

However, the scarcity of smoke image data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations, particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic dataset.

However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality. Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance."}

Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes."}
