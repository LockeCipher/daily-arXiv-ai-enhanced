Although a few existing works address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1) dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation generalizability.

In particular, state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency."}

We propose a relightable framework that integrates a microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections.

To reduce contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning, enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of 264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61 dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation, it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to nnU-Net.

The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed. In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked alternatives.

In this work, we propose \\textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems, compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods. Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods, unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models."}

Traditional image deblurring methods require a large number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel.

However, challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models.

In this work, we introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from 3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives. We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked Autoencoders.

Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in robust reconstruction.

This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism, which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions. Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective 4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user commands and further enhance editing performance.

Integrated into the state-of-the-art ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation."}

The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors 3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data.

Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users, primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived from the measured locations.

Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.   In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor details.   This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.

TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation."}

With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing.

To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components.

However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

To address this limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available."}

To effectively simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information each modality provides.

High-resolution text-to-image generators are currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size. NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average.

Viewing flow matching (FM) through stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited prompts generalize to unseen ones.

We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on 250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning shapes video representations toward human social perception."}

Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by $\\approx 17\\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a single object of interest, outperforming existing methods."}

Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise, thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently, to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, demonstrate that our $\\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness."}

Existing neural rendering approaches often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to existing Gaussian splatting methods."}

Prior works have investigated representational alignment between artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations. This leaves open a scientific question: \"how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas, and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces.\" To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information (MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our understanding of its encoding principles."}

We present a novel learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments, outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and processing time for continual personalization."}

EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference."}
