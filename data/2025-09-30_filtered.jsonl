However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task, particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency, while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail."}

In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene, which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background. Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts."}

Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods."}

On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning, leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency, but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation. Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment."}

However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method."}

In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation -- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation, we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into UniLat, eliminating redundant stages.

First, a hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0 model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal feature space.

To operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning. Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection across diverse categories.

However, the design of perceptual losses involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization. In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed alternatives.

Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.

The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures. Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.

Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our \"propose-and-validate\" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic."}

However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information.

Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However, pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance.

This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the large language model to propose improved prompts.

To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled. We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.

Most existing methods either couple different parts of the diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in sampling burden.

Existing methods often trade off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency, resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme, supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches. Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures."}

CrimEdit also extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions, enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and insertion stages."}

Our approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then, since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output. Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion."}

It not only provides a structural blueprint for ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation. M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed scenes.

Furthermore, training predictor with code-level supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration, result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the prior of missing textures.

Existing 3D and 4D approaches typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic 4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM, the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation, incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation."}

Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose \\textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic bias.

We tackle this challenge with Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content remain tightly aligned.

Even the more concerned diffusion models need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising, SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing. Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance."}

Although diffusion-based methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions, enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However, directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this to design \\textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1) Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of prompt details and the content visual quality.

However, transferring reinforcement learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model.

We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation."}

While previous research has made significant progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment, reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and lateral radiograph pairs.

We propose a tumor-generation model that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal, manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations.

This study develops an efficient 3D deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients), meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets. Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test (N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM, Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/- 0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/- 0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082.

Significance: Our proposed method generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors."}

Our model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction.

For novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module. An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.

To overcome this challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture. Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing, while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding tasks.

Second, we propose orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search. We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our code is available at \\hyperlink{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}."}

Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance."}

To address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based metrics.

Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the (diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training) for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning. Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared to MF from scratch (FID 3.43).

We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport, interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting, Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks, systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different difficulty) and the training data size.

This thesis introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.   We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments diffusion models with a register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation.   We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.

Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency.

Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising. Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content and the overall gains in physical plausibility.

In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality. We introduce \\textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies \\textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with \\textbf{GaussPainter} for \\textbf{Ex}treme 3D\\textbf{GS} compression. \\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas \\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes.

Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition, narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers (VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities. Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset. This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models."}

Despite their success, existing methods face considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals: a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge, the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different mediums."}

We investigate the scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models: training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of capacities (S through XL).

In this work, we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues: contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting. Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization and transfer better to other benchmarks.

Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to 48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%.

In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation -- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation, we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into UniLat, eliminating redundant stages.

Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians, enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines, which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines without post-processing.

Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators.

We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second, we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU, with substantially reduced error accumulation."}

This alignment yields semantically rich image tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\\times$256, our tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of 1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without classifier-free guidance.

This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems."}

While previous research accelerates diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup. Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a 4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model.

In this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists of: (1) Latent Shifting.

Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2 steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while outperforming comparable CM-based approaches."}

However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task, particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency, while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail."}

However, the compactness of LoRA adaptations introduces new safety concerns, particularly their vulnerability to model extraction attacks. This paper introduces a new focus of model extraction attacks named LoRA extraction that extracts LoRA-adaptive models based on a public pre-trained model. We then propose a novel extraction method called StolenLoRA which trains a substitute model to extract the functionality of a LoRA-adapted model using synthetic data. StolenLoRA leverages a Large Language Model to craft effective prompts for data generation, and it incorporates a Disagreement-based Semi-supervised Learning (DSL) strategy to maximize information gain from limited queries. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StolenLoRA, achieving up to a 96.60% attack success rate with only 10k queries, even in cross-backbone scenarios where the attacker and victim models utilize different pre-trained backbones. These findings reveal the specific vulnerability of LoRA-adapted models to this type of extraction and underscore the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms tailored to PEFT methods. We also explore a preliminary defense strategy based on diversified LoRA deployments, highlighting its potential to mitigate such attacks."}

In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene, which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background. Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts."}

Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods."}

We find that attention weights can be separated into two parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N) attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality, outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B."}

To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable Continuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework that enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians in a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations, thereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations. Then, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves localized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization, while ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation inheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy levels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that flexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels, enabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by approximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced robustness and stability. Moreover, at equivalent rendering quality, ReCon-GS slashes memory requirements by over 50% compared to leading state-of-the-art methods."}

Obtaining high-resolution SST data remains challenging due to limitations in physical imaging, and super-resolution via deep neural networks is a promising solution. Recently, Mamba-based approaches leveraging State Space Models (SSM) have demonstrated significant potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, their application to SST data super-resolution remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the Wavelet-assisted Mamba Super-Resolution (WMSR) framework for satellite-derived SST data. The WMSR includes two key components: the Low-Frequency State Space Module (LFSSM) and High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM). The LFSSM uses 2D-SSM to capture global information of the input data, and the robust global modeling capabilities of SSM are exploited to preserve the critical temperature information in the low-frequency component. The HFEM employs the pixel difference convolution to match and correct the high-frequency feature, achieving accurate and clear textures. Through comprehensive experiments on three SST datasets, our WMSR demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/oucailab/WMSR."}

A common approach is to formulate the problem in a Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable, estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone. SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including challenging scenarios."}

These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First, in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation, classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers."}

We present a theoretical and empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples, such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters ($\\beta$ in $\\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion process"}
