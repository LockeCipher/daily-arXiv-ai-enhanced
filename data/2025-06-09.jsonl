A Preliminary Study", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CR"], "comment": null, "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning\nacross text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex\nvision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the\nout-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,\nspecifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any\ntask-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:\nZero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a\ncurated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.\n  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in\nzero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the\nmost balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative\nanalysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual\nartifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object\nscale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible\ncomposites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing\ndetection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic\nreasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics."}

We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for\nOptical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions\nacross diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context\naggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively\nmodel both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We\ncontribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)\ndataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates\n(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions\nfrom dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\n88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in\nchallenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling\nreal-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a\nlightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with\ncompetitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it\nsuitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones.

However, its\napplication has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized\nexperimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide\nhistology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major\nlimitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they\nfactorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene\nexpression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with\nmemory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in\ntypical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative\nmodel that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution\nof gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level\nencoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without\nexcessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M\nbenchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and\nachieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models."}

Despite significant advances in\nmemory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems\nstill have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or\nreflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated\nerrors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory\nIntelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent\nsystems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for\nlongitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather\nthan passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,\nhuman-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured\ncapture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system\ncapability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this\nvision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift\ndetection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into\nsystems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,\njudgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in\ncurrent AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating\nintelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially\nresponsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,\ngenerative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions."}

Our system consists of two main sub-systems: a Sample Acquisition\nSystem (SAS) for precise, automated in-field soil sampling; and a Sample\nAnalysis Lab (Lab) for real-time soil property analysis. The system's\nperformance was validated through extensive field trials at a large-scale\nAustralian farm. Experimental results show that the SAS can consistently\nacquire soil samples with a mass of 50g at a depth of 200mm, while the Lab can\nprocess each sample within 10 minutes to accurately measure pH and\nmacronutrients.

Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)\noffers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing\ndesigns suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work\naddresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework\nthat significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model\ninference.
