However, existing 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face significant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as incomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To address these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization framework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting and 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach divides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling targeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global structural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through voxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate geometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate lighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D wavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance variations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail reconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global structure. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, surpassing existing approaches and advancing the field of 3D scene reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6e\u5ed3\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6e\u5ed3\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u54083D\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u548c2D\u91c7\u6837\uff1a(1)\u901a\u8fc73D\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff1b(2)\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff1b(3)\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\u6062\u590d\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6a21\u5757\uff1b(4)\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u5e94\u75282D\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u62df\u8f90\u5c04\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u91cd\u5efa", "result": "\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e863D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f"}}

To enable effective visualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis techniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate novel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on reconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization exploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a novel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and tracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and analysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic volumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate segmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for coarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network for fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results within the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous tracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against state-of-the-art methods.

Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2) hidden pixels in novel views can be \"inpainted\" with feed-forward 2D video diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of in-the-wild videos.

Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population, which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS). Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under metabolic stress. By linking detailed   vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust, non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8840\u6e05\u8102\u8d28\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u65e0\u75c7\u72b6\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u6b7b\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u4e9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8102\u8d28\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u9ad8\u6548\u6db2\u76f8\u8272\u8c31-\u7535\u55b7\u96fe\u7535\u79bb\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u8d28\u8c31\uff08UHPLC-ESI-HRMS\uff09\u5206\u6790\u8840\u6e05\u8102\u8d28\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u52a8\u8109\u5e73\u5747\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3001\u8840\u7ba1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u8102\u8d28\u4e9a\u7c7b\uff08\u5982TAGs\u3001DAGs\u548cCers\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u4ee3\u8c22\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u91cd\u5851\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9884\u9632\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, current text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts, oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a \"global emotion localization--local muscle control\" mechanism to refine micro-expression dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD and HDTF.

In this paper, we propose local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes.

This approach preserves the most salient local features while minimizing computational overhead.

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative nature of diffusion models.

In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space.

To address these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low classification confidence.

(2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning, severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution. Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and cross-dataset generalization.

The detection task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities. Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images, employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image data.

As AI-generated visual content becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation, ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes, creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training, and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling over 7 hours of video content.

These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone.

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models.

Cattin and Florian Kofler: equal contribution", "summary": "Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81 s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting.

Fusing high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF) calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an $\\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpectraLift\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08LR-HSI\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08HR-MSI\uff09\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08HR-HSI\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u70b9\u6269\u6563\u51fd\u6570\uff08PSF\uff09\u6821\u51c6\u6216\u771f\u5b9eHR-HSI\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08HSI\uff09\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684PSF\u6821\u51c6\u6216\u771f\u5b9eHR-HSI\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "SpectraLift\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\uff08SRF\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08LR-MSI\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0cLR-HSI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5149\u8c31\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "SpectraLift\u5728PSNR\u3001SAM\u3001SSIM\u548cRMSE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\uff0c\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "SpectraLift\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}
