While meshes offer high precision, their dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized (tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation, and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency, high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability."}

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

Like other single deep regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB, surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced complexity."}

The motivation for using a VAE is that the generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN.

However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.

However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge, granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.

As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality. Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise approximation and edge model switching.

Although unsupervised part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors. By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover, several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple categories.

To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise, region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves region-specific style mixing according to the given masks."}

First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning in Tempe, Arizona.

Unlike heuristic or low-expressivity alternatives, our method leverages RealNVP to learn a flexible density over poses represented in the 6D rotation format. We address the challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for integrating pose priors into human motion capture and reconstruction pipelines."}

This leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git."}

We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal.

However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple forgery-related auxiliary losses.

We propose a novel \\textbf{concept erasure} method for text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative repertoire. Our method, termed \\textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity, explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality. Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by 5--10\\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance. Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch."}

This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution."}

While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets, including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy, generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated by the diffusion model from a single image."}

It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony structures and soft-tissue contrast."}

While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches.

However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy. The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by aligning all the \"sharp\" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii) magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%. Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications."}

While meshes offer high precision, their dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized (tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation, and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency, high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability."}

Inspired by neural radiance fields (NeRF), which learn a volumetric representation of a 3D scene from 2D images, this work proposes a novel approach to reconstruct an informative 3D latent motion representation from one-dimensional Doppler velocity projections extracted from Wi-Fi CSI. The resulting latent representation is then used to construct a uniform Doppler radiance field (DoRF) of the motion, providing a comprehensive view of the performed activity and improving the robustness to environmental variability. The results show that the proposed approach noticeably enhances the generalization accuracy of Wi-Fi-based HAR, highlighting the strong potential of DoRFs for practical sensing applications."}

However, some of these methods are specific developed for specific domains. If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation. This issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability. To address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual learning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge integration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model merging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the parameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on different domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which minimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the domain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge while maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant regardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required. Experimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual learning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its effectiveness in dynamic scenarios."}
