The key challenge lies in formulating a compact yet expressive material representation. To address this, we propose TransGI, a novel neural rendering method for real-time, high-fidelity global illumination. It comprises an object-centric neural transfer model for material representation and a radiance-sharing lighting system for efficient illumination. Traditional BSDF representations and spatial neural material representations lack expressiveness, requiring thousands of ray evaluations to converge to noise-free colors. Conversely, real-time methods trade quality for efficiency by supporting only diffuse materials. In contrast, our object-centric neural transfer model achieves compactness and expressiveness through an MLP-based decoder and vertex-attached latent features, supporting glossy effects with low memory overhead. For dynamic, varying lighting conditions, we introduce local light probes capturing scene radiance, coupled with an across-probe radiance-sharing strategy for efficient probe generation.

Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability.

In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it, trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts.

Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment.

To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard, eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage, our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner.

By integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic inference for flexible and controllable sampling.

Using neural networks trained on large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward 3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision, and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation, eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level transformations.

Specifically, we first minimize the composite transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians; and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques.

This task remains fundamentally challenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and ambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D knowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding explicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and ground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts have sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera poses of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and the necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend: the performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as data scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D knowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated by and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D inductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By eliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and learns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D inductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel views, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed inputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our data-centric paradigm.

To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the stylistic reference.

In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training.

However, the accumulated noise in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods.

Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ming-Omni\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7MoE\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMing-Omni\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "Ming-Omni\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u4e0eGPT-4o\u76f8\u5f53\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

INRs represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end, we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image from its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a sufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem. To validate our theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the performance of INRs on super-resolution recovery of continuous domain phantom images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INRs\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4f4e\u901a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22INRs\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u50cf\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u4e0eINRs\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u9690\u85cf\u5c42ReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684INR\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e7f\u4e49\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u4f4e\u901a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86INR\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8db3\u591f\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f4e\u5bbd\u5ea6INR\u7684\u6062\u590d\u6982\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "INRs\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4f4e\u901a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}
