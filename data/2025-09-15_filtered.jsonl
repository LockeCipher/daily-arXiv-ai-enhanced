PSI consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction, involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data, corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful \"intermediate structures\", in a zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive improvements."}

Its core, privacy-preserving principle is that participants only exchange model updates, such as gradients, and never their raw, sensitive data. This approach is fundamental for applications in domains where privacy and confidentiality are important. However, the security of this very mechanism is threatened by gradient inversion attacks, which can reverse-engineer private training data directly from the shared gradients, defeating the purpose of FL. While the impact of these attacks is known for image, text, and tabular data, their effect on video data remains an unexamined area of research. This paper presents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient inversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one employing pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video frames with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use of feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion attacks. We also demonstrate that image super-resolution techniques can enhance the frames extracted through gradient inversion attacks, enabling attackers to reconstruct higher-quality videos. Our experiments validate this across scenarios where the attacker has access to zero, one, or more reference frames from the target environment. We find that although feature extractors make attacks more challenging, leakage is still possible if the classifier lacks sufficient complexity. We, therefore, conclude that video data leakage in FL is a viable threat, and the conditions under which it occurs warrant further investigation."}

While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency. Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference stage. The code will be released."}

To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust, scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable: it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ significantly enhances image generation performance, surpassing visual autoregressive models (VAR) by 0.5 and diffusion models (DiT) by 0.2 rFID, highlighting the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong autoregressive image generation."}

Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance. Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and representation efficiency in space scenarios."}

To address these limitations, we propose GAMMA, a novel training framework designed to reduce domain bias and enhance semantic alignment. GAMMA introduces diverse manipulation strategies, such as inpainting-based manipulation and semantics-preserving perturbations, to ensure consistency between manipulated and authentic content. We employ multi-task supervision with dual segmentation heads and a classification head, enabling pixel-level source attribution across diverse generative domains. In addition, a reverse cross-attention mechanism is introduced to allow the segmentation heads to guide and correct biased representations in the classification branch. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on the GenImage benchmark, imporving accuracy by 5.8%, but also maintains strong robustness on newly released generative model such as GPT-4o."}

Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods aim to address these limitations by combining slice-to-volume registration and super-resolution techniques to generate high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes. While several SRR methods have been proposed, their comparative performance - particularly in pathological cases - and their influence on downstream volumetric analysis and diagnostic tasks remain underexplored. In this study, we applied three state-of-the-art SRR method - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to 140 fetal brain MRI scans, including both healthy controls (HC) and pathological cases (PC) with ventriculomegaly (VM). Each HR reconstruction was segmented using the BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine principal brain structures. We evaluated visual quality, SRR success rates, volumetric measurement agreement, and diagnostic classification performance. NeSVoR demonstrated the highest and most consistent reconstruction success rate (>90%) across both HC and PC groups. Although significant differences in volumetric estimates were observed between SRR methods, classification performance for VM was not affected by the choice of SRR method. These findings highlight NeSVoR's robustness and the resilience of diagnostic performance despite SRR-induced volumetric variability."}

Despite advancements in diffusion models, current methods still face two critical challenges. The first is mask hallucination, where the model generates irrelevant or spurious content inside the masked region, and the second is mask-shape bias, where the model fills the masked area with an object that mimics the mask's shape rather than surrounding content. To address these issues, we propose Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR), a novel training strategy designed specifically for object removal tasks. During training, our approach introduces two mask perturbations: dilation and reshape, enforcing consistency between the outputs of these perturbed branches and the original mask. The dilated masks help align the model's output with the surrounding content, while reshaped masks encourage the model to break the mask-shape bias. This combination of strategies enables MCR to produce more robust and contextually coherent inpainting results. Our experiments demonstrate that MCR significantly reduces hallucinations and mask-shape bias, leading to improved performance in object removal."}

To fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development.

Recently, feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing the original model by 0.51%. The code is available at https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/Cache4Diffusion."}

We introduce I-Segmenter, the first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and inference, we propose $\\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling, ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to 3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes.

This paper introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed, less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.
