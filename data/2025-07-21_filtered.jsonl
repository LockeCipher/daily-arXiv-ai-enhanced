To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-latent integration framework that en-hances feature interactions between the base latent and refined latent representations.

Existing VolVis approaches have explored non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness, and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives, extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes, resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and editing flexibility."}

Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion (MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD.

Existing construction methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes, they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour, ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods, including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets, and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for cardiovascular research."}

In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage, confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay fidelity.

Unfortunately, dominant approaches rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based framework, dubbed \\ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \\ours performs DM to generate the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture details. Extensive evaluations show that \\ours provides a promising unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used benchmarks."}

However, the sole usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh. The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around 20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Image restoration has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet). Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time."}

However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement, current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels. The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness of our method.

Pre-trained diffusion models have been increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion, resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration."}

However, existing systems often face challenges: high model complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments, unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing, combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA), outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in resource-constrained environments."}

Specifically, this paper focuses on the urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery, proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.

However, it often struggles to handle scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and 3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories."}

For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time. Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering. Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk."}

We introduce DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage."}

We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only 1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models, coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings."}

However, due to privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing. However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level, to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions, we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation. Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics."}

Existing VolVis approaches have explored non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness, and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives, extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes, resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and editing flexibility."}

We present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172 participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models: a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art 3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use cases, and limitations are discussed."}

However, these degradation kernels, which model the transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels. By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks."}
