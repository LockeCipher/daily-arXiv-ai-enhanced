We propose the DualPhys-GS framework to achieve high-quality underwater reconstruction through a dual-path optimization mechanism. Our approach further develops a dual feature-guided attenuation-scattering modeling mechanism, the RGB-guided attenuation optimization model combines RGB features and depth information and can handle edge and structural details. In contrast, the multi-scale depth-aware scattering model captures scattering effects at different scales using a feature pyramid network and an attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we design several special loss functions. The attenuation scattering consistency loss ensures physical consistency. The water body type adaptive loss dynamically adjusts the weighting coefficients. The edge-aware scattering loss is used to maintain the sharpness of structural edges. The multi-scale feature loss helps to capture global and local structural information. In addition, we design a scene adaptive mechanism that can automatically identify the water-body-type characteristics (e.g., clear coral reef waters or turbid coastal waters) and dynamically adjust the scattering and attenuation parameters and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in several metrics, especially in suspended matter-dense regions and long-distance scenes, and the reconstruction quality is significantly improved."}

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy, storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class. Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another. Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation."}

However, existing approaches manifest two critical limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control. Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact scene representations with 50\\% reduced memory consumption through optimized Gaussians utilization."}

Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks, such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves 8$\\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\\times$ lower GPU memory consumption, and 14$\\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM. Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks. We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules, highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging.

However, a critical limitation of existing RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131 LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures.

In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image, regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches over 65\\% on various testing sets.

To address these, we present two key innovations. First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential, but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable 3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy. It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to 1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark."}

To enhance the adaptability of these models under complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction and enhances detail recovery.

While recent advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation, head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results, but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian head avatars and support real-time appearance editing."}

We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work, we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation."}

Recently, latent diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely, generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements. To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access."}

However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention (MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability of the pre-trained SISR model.

PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement.

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications."}

Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time, and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence. Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second, to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x 16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time, achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect this connection."}

To this end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios.

We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 % of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM) above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling inference time, limiting its clinical practicality.

These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively.

The first, a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach, learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement. We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them. To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in diffusion-generated training videos.

Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data? In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries. Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o. In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance across standard benchmarks.

Although simulation training offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies, focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT."}

Furthermore, a constraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion classification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further enhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent liver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework offers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional contrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and reliability for the assessment of liver lesion. The implementation of T-CACE is publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/T-CACE."}
