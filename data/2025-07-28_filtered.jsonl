However, their reliance on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS (ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight, detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However, the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset. Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether."}

Neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors, preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes, and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/"}

This task is notably challenging due to the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB, that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the LRS3 dataset."}

While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement, enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving high-quality rendering performance."}

We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However, due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks, these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods.

First, our Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local context to guide reconstruction.

To address this issue, we design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\\% compared to existing methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art text-to-image models.

In this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework, where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of synthesized mammograms.

We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal data.

Recently, approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on representative 4D phantom datasets."}

Existing gesture generation research mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics.

Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/", "summary": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes. It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/"}

Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2) a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3) and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize 3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques. This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision, the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications."}

We show that DINO-world outperforms previous models on a variety of video prediction benchmarks, e.g. segmentation and depth forecasting, and demonstrates strong understanding of intuitive physics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to fine-tune the predictor on observation-action trajectories. The resulting action-conditioned world model can be used for planning by simulating candidate trajectories in latent space."}

When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper, a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem, the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \\pgdm baseline, the proposed framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \\(25\\%\\) for inpainting with both random and center masks, and \\(23\\%\\) and \\(24\\%\\) for \\(4\\times\\) and \\(8\\times\\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM."}

Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss) combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing 1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume compared to existing approaches.
