Neural rendering is an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from previously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering methods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene because these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed for quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for reconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of geometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view synthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit use of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene (captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale, implicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids explicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational cost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the scene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth information of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex scenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is independent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering large-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than using explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach can potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications."}

However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets. Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input. Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages in scene layout synthesis."}

Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.

The application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF."}

However, from a human perspective, such models do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity. Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI), is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating these artifacts (i.e., \"hallucinations\"). We observe that hallucinations are not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a \"Hallucination Score\" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions to mitigate hallucinations."}

However, the high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions, which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges. First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second, existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method. The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions. Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks."}

However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the existing methods."}

We introduce StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for enhanced facial fidelity.

The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the structure of articulated shapes.

Thus, it is natural for us to find a connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to further enhance the robustness of our model.

Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers (e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis.

In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To (Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference, an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips, reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive simulations.

Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function, and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and robustness against suboptimal rank initialization.

The benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use, material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical plausibility is crucial.

To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer (l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative generative models.

Methods: T2-weighted 0.55T lung MRI dataset including 44 patients with previous covid infection were used. A self-supervised learning framework was developed, where each blade of the PROPELLER acquisition was split along the readout direction into two partitions. One subset trains the unrolled reconstruction network, while the other subset is used for loss calculation, enabling self-supervised training without clean targets and leveraging matched noise statistics for denoising. For comparison, Marchenko-Pastur Principal Component Analysis (MPPCA) was performed along the coil dimension, followed by conventional parallel imaging reconstruction. The quality of the reconstructed lung MRI was assessed visually by two experienced radiologists independently.   Results: The proposed self-supervised model improved the clarity and structural integrity of the lung images. For cases with available CT scans, the reconstructed images demonstrated strong alignment with corresponding CT images. Additionally, the proposed model enables further scan time reduction by requiring only half the number of blades. Reader evaluations confirmed that the proposed method outperformed MPPCA-denoised images across all categories (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p<0.001), with moderate inter-reader agreement (weighted Cohen's kappa=0.55; percentage of exact and within +/-1 point agreement=91%).

However, traditional rule-based detectors for HFOs suffer from unsatisfactory precision, producing false positives that require time-consuming manual review. Supervised machine learning approaches have been used to classify the detection results, yet they typically depend on labeled datasets, which are difficult to acquire due to the need for specialized expertise. Moreover, accurate labeling of HFOs is challenging due to low inter-rater reliability and inconsistent annotation practices across institutions. The lack of a clear consensus on what constitutes a pathological HFO further challenges supervised refinement approaches. To address this, we leverage the insight that legacy detectors reliably capture clinically relevant signals despite their relatively high false positive rates. We thus propose the Self-Supervised to Label Discovery (SS2LD) framework to refine the large set of candidate events generated by legacy detectors into a precise set of pathological HFOs. SS2LD employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) for morphological pre-training to learn meaningful latent representation of the detected events. These representations are clustered to derive weak supervision for pathological events. A classifier then uses this supervision to refine detection boundaries, trained on real and VAE-augmented data. Evaluated on large multi-institutional interictal iEEG datasets, SS2LD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. SS2LD offers a scalable, label-efficient, and clinically effective strategy to identify pathological HFOs using legacy detectors."}

Neural rendering is an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from previously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering methods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene because these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed for quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for reconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of geometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view synthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit use of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene (captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale, implicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids explicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational cost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the scene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth information of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex scenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is independent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering large-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than using explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach can potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications."}

This can have dire consequences for scientific and medical inverse problems, such as MRI and microscopy denoising, where accuracy is more important than perceptual quality. Uncertainty quantification techniques, such as conformal prediction, can pinpoint outliers and provide guarantees for image regression tasks, improving reliability. However, existing methods utilize a linear constant scaling factor to calibrate uncertainty bounds, resulting in larger, less informative bounds. We propose QUTCC, a quantile uncertainty training and calibration technique that enables nonlinear, non-uniform scaling of quantile predictions to enable tighter uncertainty estimates. Using a U-Net architecture with a quantile embedding, QUTCC enables the prediction of the full conditional distribution of quantiles for the imaging task. During calibration, QUTCC generates uncertainty bounds by iteratively querying the network for upper and lower quantiles, progressively refining the bounds to obtain a tighter interval that captures the desired coverage. We evaluate our method on several denoising tasks as well as compressive MRI reconstruction. Our method successfully pinpoints hallucinations in image estimates and consistently achieves tighter uncertainty intervals than prior methods while maintaining the same statistical coverage."}

Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets. Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input. Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages in scene layout synthesis."}

To address this issue, this study proposes a detection framework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the C3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve detection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to reduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing the spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to enhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant computations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally, the CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps in a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures detailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions.

The application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF."}
