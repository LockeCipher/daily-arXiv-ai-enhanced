J. Kim, C. Sun, and M. Stengel contributed   equally", "summary": "Radiance fields have revolutionized photo-realistic 3D scene visualization by enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of complex environments, making them an ideal match for light field displays. However, integrating these technologies presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently rendering each view, while preserving image quality."}

FastAvatar uses a novel encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face ``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures. Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion, model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g., FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in consumer and interactive systems."}

While reconstruction methods such as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687 annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO), together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research.

However, when addressing the side effects of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision. This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes, objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

However, spatial domain SNR priors have two limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference, and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT) bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model (EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior 3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\\%) while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

These methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications."}

VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently, NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding state-of-the-art results."}

While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts."}

Given a 3D model, VoxHammer first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and key-value tokens at each timestep.

Our self-evaluation approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric.
