However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models. Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released at:https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DeepRobustWatermark."}

In addition, traditional static condition control makes it difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network, demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets.

We present an external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective for both cursive and complex characters."}

However, current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures, thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline (backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications, this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The code will be available upon acceptance."}

Submitted to Computers in Biology and   Medicine for peer review", "summary": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality. Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback, trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of 41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to 94\\%, achieving 4\\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate LDCT imaging."}

Supported by IHI   SYNTHIA project", "summary": "Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI images."}

Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.

Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting, are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry assets.

Our architecture is built upon a VAE-UNet backbone that jointly reconstructs input patches and generates voxel-level segmentation masks, allowing the model to learn disentangled representations of anatomical structure and appearance. We introduce a patch-based training pipeline that selectively injects synthetic patches generated from the learned latent space, and systematically study the effects of varying synthetic-to-real patch ratios during training. To further enhance output fidelity, the framework incorporates perceptual reconstruction loss using VGG features, as well as a PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial supervision over spatial realism. Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that our approach improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in boundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid generative-discriminative training regimes for small-organ segmentation and provide new insights into balancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce scenarios."}
