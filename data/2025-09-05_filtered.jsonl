Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.

On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars.

To address this issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets."}

In this work, we propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis, leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217 measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides anatomical structure constraints.

While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto 3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image. Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First, we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training."}

The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation."}

Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale, cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods."}
