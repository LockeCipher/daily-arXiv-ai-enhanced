In proceedings of NICOGRAPH International 2025", "summary": "Creating high-quality anime illustrations presents notable challenges, particularly for beginners, due to the intricate styles and fine details inherent in anime art. We present an interactive drawing guidance system specifically designed for anime illustrations to address this issue. It offers real-time guidance to help users refine their work and streamline the creative process. Our system is built upon the StreamDiffusion pipeline to deliver real-time drawing assistance. We fine-tune Stable Diffusion with LoRA to synthesize anime style RGB images from user-provided hand-drawn sketches and prompts. Leveraging the Informative Drawings model, we transform these RGB images into rough sketches, which are further refined into structured guidance sketches using a custom-designed optimizer. The proposed system offers precise, real-time guidance aligned with the creative intent of the user, significantly enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of the drawing process. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study, gathering empirical feedback on both system performance and interface usability."}

While recent generative models enable intuitive generation of vector fields from user sketches, they struggle to maintain physical properties such as incompressibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for interactively designing 2D vector fields. Conventional generative models can intuitively generate vector fields from user sketches, but remain difficult to consider physical properties. Therefore, we add a simple editing process after generating the vector field. In the first stage, we use a latent diffusion model~(LDM) to automatically generate initial 2D vector fields from user sketches. In the second stage, we apply the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition to locally extract physical properties such as incompressibility from the results generated by LDM and recompose them according to user intentions. Through multiple experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

This is a challenging problem particularly when rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles in real time."}

Our approach begins by generating synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations. These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible."}

Such an imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions. Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and ImageNetLT."}

Recently, this framework has been extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point cloud self-supervised learning.

Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming efficiency."}

While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\\% in mIoU and 36.9\\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while maintaining coherence in surrounding regions.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME) approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular, THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.

To capture and transfer these movements into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted, which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as occlusions and distorted body proportions.   There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views, and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs. Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves generalizability.   Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a Stable Diffusion backbone.   Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more accessible and generalizable telepresence systems."}

The peer-reviewed version of this paper has been   accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop CVAMD", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.

Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding (DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on CPU devices."}

While several anomaly synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies, enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks, while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and classification."}

CT scans are the key imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework, particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives."}

Various deep learning approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with < 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S. and Israel.

VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD). $L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework."}

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on spurious factors in the counterfactuals.

However, most existing learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA, which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention, which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world scenarios.

In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a new solution for graphic design."}

Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module.

Our method fuses multiple low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic, multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous, semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions.

While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.

However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity, clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and identity-preserving full-body synthesis."}

It has been shown that, in comparison to regular DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method."}

Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained, identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process. This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips. Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation, showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video restoration."}

However, previous works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment, we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our method efficiently mitigates the misalignment."}

In terms of selection, we construct a reference selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.

This work demonstrates that a pre-trained VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present \\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By integrating \\textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook capacity and a \\textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches: ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours, whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs."}

Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

Turner"], "title": "Warm Starts Accelerate Generative Modelling", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "comment": "10 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data. However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I) prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose moments are conditioned on the input context. This \"warm start\" substantially reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification, allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further acceleration. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/warm-start-model."}

Such synthetic datasets can mitigate the scarcity of public datasets for artificial intelligence research, and can also be used for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose a combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR) for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X 512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100 synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding to random guessing)."}

We demonstrate that DPM++ 2M with linear-decreasing CFG scheduling yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while reducing artifacts.

The framework comprises three variants of increasing complexity, integrating theoretically grounded Langevin inference, adaptive noise schedule learning, parallel reconstruction sampling, and warm-start initialization from classical solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, both in terms of fidelity and perceptual quality."}

Recently, look-up table (LUT)-based approaches have attracted interest due to their efficiency and performance. However, these methods are typically designed for fixed scale factors, making them unsuitable for arbitrary-scale image SR (ASISR). Existing ASISR techniques often employ implicit neural representations, which come with considerable computational cost and memory demands. To address these limitations, we propose Interpolation Mixing LUT (IM-LUT), a novel framework that operates ASISR by learning to blend multiple interpolation functions to maximize their representational capacity. Specifically, we introduce IM-Net, a network trained to predict mixing weights for interpolation functions based on local image patterns and the target scale factor. To enhance efficiency of interpolation-based methods, IM-Net is transformed into IM-LUT, where LUTs are employed to replace computationally expensive operations, enabling lightweight and fast inference on CPUs while preserving reconstruction quality. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IM-LUT consistently achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a promising solution for resource-constrained applications."}

To address this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System (EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million parameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer models, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches.

This is a challenging problem particularly when rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles in real time."}
