However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics, Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains 40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to enhance overall performance.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views.

Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details.

SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.

In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and feature-level contrast.

Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD, Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on head samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "GALTraj\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u91ca\u653e\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGALTraj\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c3e\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u5c3e\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08WOMD\u3001Argoverse2\uff09\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff08QCNet\u3001MTR\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cGALTraj\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c3e\u90e8\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5934\u90e8\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GALTraj\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

LOTS leverages a global description with paired localized sketch + text information for conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image.

Specifically, we leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring re-training on each target dataset.

Traditional methods have struggled with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency. The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information (past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2.

However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers, posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of 0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.771.

In this paper, we propose an AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality, demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u5668\uff08LCS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u8f7bGPU\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u653e\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5185\u5bb9\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u5982NPU\uff09\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7f29\u653e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "LCS\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08ESR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GameIR\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "LCS\u5728\u4e94\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eAMD\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6848\uff08EASF\u548cFSR1\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "LCS\u5c55\u793a\u4e86ESR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u653e\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, adversaries may misuse such techniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages into harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work, we take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful illusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation models. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are hateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or subtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models (VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection accuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs. We further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which mainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary layer of information, i.e., hidden messages.
