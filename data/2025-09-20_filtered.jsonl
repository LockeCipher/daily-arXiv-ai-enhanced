However, this potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence."}

Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization."}

Existing edge-aware methods often attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones, yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation for advancing perceptual super-resolution."}

The recent state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process, we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the real-scanned dataset."}

Current SD-map-based approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g., OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals, achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods."}

It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark.

While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise, they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of 3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \\textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction. Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses."}

Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\\% of the original dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset."}

Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a 3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset. Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics.

Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG), while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring architectural modifications.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised by a single RGB video.

However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries, which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs. This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG behavior covertly.   We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility, to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings. Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to reassess the shared instructional prompts."}

Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks.   The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG."}

As a generative paradigm originally designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy."}

We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models."}

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

Code: https://github.com/cvg/diffmvs", "summary": "To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory. CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and ETH3D. Code is available at: https://github.com/cvg/diffmvs."}

The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility, clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting.

Integrating partial differential equation (PDE) based physics knowledge with machine learning provides enhanced interpretability and utility over classic numerical methods. However, current physics-integrated machine learning methods are limited to considering a single PDE, severely limiting their application to diseases where multiple mechanisms are responsible for different groups (i.e., subtypes) and aggravating problems with model misspecification and degeneracy. Here, we present a deep generative model for learning mixtures of latent dynamic models governed by physics-based PDEs, going beyond traditional approaches that assume a single PDE structure. Our method integrates reaction-diffusion PDEs within a variational autoencoder (VAE) mixture model framework, supporting inference of subtypes of interpretable latent variables (e.g. diffusivity and reaction rates) from neuroimaging data. We evaluate our method on synthetic benchmarks and demonstrate its potential for uncovering mechanistic subtypes of Alzheimer's disease progression from positron emission tomography (PET) data."}

However, this potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence."}
