The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

However, existing methods often rely on either high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D Gaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this paper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for achieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel agent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling. ImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight geometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates photorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies. Specifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base world synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery.This reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by enabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that integrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation and decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies, preserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact representations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To automate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling agents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial reasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with dynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion. Experiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that ImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering efficiency compared to prior methods.

Meanwhile, Mamba excels at capturing low-frequency features like facial color and fine-grained texture, and does so with lower complexity than Transformers.

We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings.

Despite deep models have made significant advances in capturing the discriminative long-term dependency of surgical videos to achieve improved recognition, they rarely account for exploring and modeling the uncertainty in surgical videos, which should be crucial for reliable online surgical phase recognition. We categorize the sources of uncertainty into two types, frame ambiguity in videos and unbalanced distribution among surgical phases, which are inevitable in surgical videos. To address this pivot issue, we introduce a meta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model (Meta-SurDiff), to take full advantage of the deep generative model and meta-learning in achieving precise frame-level distribution estimation for reliable online surgical phase recognition. For coarse recognition caused by ambiguous video frames, we employ a classification diffusion model to assess the confidence of recognition results at a finer-grained frame-level instance. For coarse recognition caused by unbalanced phase distribution, we use a meta-learning based objective to learn the diffusion model, thus enhancing the robustness of classification boundaries for different surgical phases.We establish effectiveness of Meta-SurDiff in online surgical phase recognition through extensive experiments on five widely used datasets using more than four practical metrics. The datasets include Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, and NurViD, where OphNet comes from ophthalmic surgeries, NurViD is the daily care dataset, while the others come from laparoscopic surgeries.

To address this, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HRGS), a memory-efficient framework with hierarchical block-level optimization. First, we generate a global, coarse Gaussian representation from low-resolution data. Then, we partition the scene into multiple blocks, refining each block with high-resolution data. The partitioning involves two steps: Gaussian partitioning, where irregular scenes are normalized into a bounded cubic space with a uniform grid for task distribution, and training data partitioning, where only relevant observations are retained for each block. By guiding block refinement with the coarse Gaussian prior, we ensure seamless Gaussian fusion across adjacent blocks. To reduce computational demands, we introduce Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP), which computes importance scores for each Gaussian and removes those with minimal contribution, speeding up convergence and reducing memory usage. Additionally, we incorporate normal priors from a pretrained model to enhance surface reconstruction quality. Our method enables high-quality, high-resolution 3D scene reconstruction even under memory constraints. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that HRGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution novel view synthesis (NVS) and surface reconstruction tasks."}

The training is done purely in the functional space, and thus is highly efficient. At inference time, we use the pointwise map corresponding to the current functional map as guidance during the diffusion process. The guidance can additionally encourage different functional map objectives, such as orthogonality and commutativity with the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

To address this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic framework that introduces group-wise conditioning control. DCFG builds on an attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups. For counterfactual generation, we partition attributes into intervened and invariant sets based on a causal graph and apply distinct guidance to each. Experiments on CelebA-HQ, MIMIC-CXR, and EMBED show that DCFG improves intervention fidelity, mitigates unintended changes, and enhances reversibility, enabling more faithful and interpretable counterfactual image generation."}

Our method is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or finetuning. Instead, we guide the generation by optimizing text prompts based on an assumed causal graph, addressing the challenge of latent space control in LDMs. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Our results demonstrate that causally faithful video counterfactuals can be effectively generated within the learned distribution of LDMs through prompt-based causal steering.

Existing studies primarily focus on image-based relighting, while with scant exploration into text-based scenarios. Some works employ intricate disentanglement pipeline designs relying on environment maps to provide relevant information, which grapples with the expensive data cost required for intrinsic decomposition and light source. Other methods take this task as an image translation problem and perform pixel-level transformation with autoencoder architecture. While these methods have achieved decent harmonization effects, they struggle to generate realistic and natural light interaction effects between the foreground and background. To alleviate these challenges, we reorganize the input data into a unified format and leverage the semantic prior provided by the pretrained diffusion model to facilitate the generation of natural results. Moreover, we propose a Position-Guided Light Adapter (PGLA) that condenses light information from different directions in the background into designed light query embeddings, and modulates the foreground with direction-biased masked attention.

Existing approaches that generate future images for risk estimation are complex and impractical. Additionally, previous methods fail to localize anatomical knee landmarks, limiting interpretability. We address these gaps with a new interpretable machine learning method to estimate the risk of knee OA progression via multi-task predictive modelling that classifies future knee OA severity and predicts anatomical knee landmarks from efficiently generated high-quality future images. Such image generation is achieved by leveraging a diffusion model in a class-conditioned latent space to forecast disease progression, offering a visual representation of how particular health conditions may evolve.

To address the increasing demand for higher accuracy, we propose a versatile iterative framework based on surrogate diffusion. This framework can enhance the performance of any calibration method without requiring architectural modifications. Specifically, the initial extrinsic parameters undergo iterative refinement through a denoising process, in which the original calibration method serves as a surrogate denoiser to estimate the final extrinsics at each step. For comparative analysis, we selected four state-of-the-art calibration methods as surrogate denoisers and compared the results of our diffusion process with those of two other iterative approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when integrated with our diffusion model, all calibration methods achieve higher accuracy, improved robustness, and greater stability compared to other iterative techniques and their single-step counterparts."}

A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial expressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic results. To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the ''devil'' in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk++, which features a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with Gaussian Splatting to ensure consistent subject identity preservation and a Face-Sync Controller that aligns lip movements with speech while innovatively using a 3D facial blendshape model to reconstruct accurate facial expressions. To ensure natural head movements, we propose a Head-Sync Stabilizer, which optimizes head poses for greater stability. Additionally, SyncTalk++ enhances robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) audio by incorporating an Expression Generator and a Torso Restorer, which generate speech-matched facial expressions and seamless torso regions. Our approach maintains consistency and continuity in visual details across frames and significantly improves rendering speed and quality, achieving up to 101 frames per second. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that SyncTalk++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synchronization and realism.

Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB that by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our approach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that achievable by any of these models alone."}

However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions."}

Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion. Furthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF facilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33% over state-of-the-art methods.

In contrast, vast amounts of action-free video data are readily available, but translating these observations into effective policies remains a challenge. We introduce AMPLIFY, a novel framework that leverages large-scale video data by encoding visual dynamics into compact, discrete motion tokens derived from keypoint trajectories. Our modular approach separates visual motion prediction from action inference, decoupling the challenges of learning what motion defines a task from how robots can perform it. We train a forward dynamics model on abundant action-free videos and an inverse dynamics model on a limited set of action-labeled examples, allowing for independent scaling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the learned dynamics are both accurate, achieving up to 3.7x better MSE and over 2.5x better pixel prediction accuracy compared to prior approaches, and broadly useful. In downstream policy learning, our dynamics predictions enable a 1.2-2.2x improvement in low-data regimes, a 1.4x average improvement by learning from action-free human videos, and the first generalization to LIBERO tasks from zero in-distribution action data. Beyond robotic control, we find the dynamics learned by AMPLIFY to be a versatile latent world model, enhancing video prediction quality. Our results present a novel paradigm leveraging heterogeneous data sources to build efficient, generalizable world models. More information can be found at https://amplify-robotics.github.io/."}

This study aims to develop an unsupervised training approach for automatically identifying anomalies in imaging scans.   We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline. In the first stage, a VQ-GAN is trained to accurately reconstruct normal subjects. In the second stage, random cube masking and ONJ-specific masking are applied to train a new encoder capable of recovering the data.   The proposed method achieves successful segmentation on both simulated and real patient data.   This approach provides a fast initial segmentation solution, reducing the burden of manual labeling.

By leveraging small \"mimicking organ\" datasets, synthetic models that replicate tissue properties and bleeding, our approach reduces ethical concerns and data-collection costs. orGAN builds on StyleGAN with Relational Positional Learning to simulate bleeding events realistically and mark bleeding coordinates. A LaMa-based inpainting module then restores clean, pre-bleed visuals, enabling precise pixel-level annotations. In evaluations, a balanced dataset of orGAN and mimicking-organ images achieved 90% detection accuracy in surgical settings and up to 99% frame-level accuracy. While our development data lack diverse organ morphologies and contain intraoperative artifacts, orGAN markedly advances ethical, efficient, and cost-effective creation of realistic annotated bleeding datasets, supporting broader integration of AI in surgical practice."}

However, existing methods often rely on either high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D Gaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this paper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for achieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel agent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling. ImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight geometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates photorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies. Specifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base world synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery.This reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by enabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that integrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation and decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies, preserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact representations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To automate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling agents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial reasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with dynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion. Experiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that ImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering efficiency compared to prior methods.

We extend self-explainable Prototypical Variational models with autoencoder-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection: A Variational Autoencoder is applied to learn a meaningful latent space which can be used for distance-based classification, likelihood estimation for OOD detection, and reconstruction. The In-Distribution (ID) region is defined by a Gaussian mixture distribution with learned prototypes representing the center of each mode. Furthermore, a novel restriction loss is introduced that promotes a compact ID region in the latent space without collapsing it into single points. The reconstructive capabilities of the Autoencoder ensure the explainability of the prototypes and the ID region of the classifier, further aiding the discrimination of OOD samples. Extensive evaluations on common OOD detection benchmarks as well as a large-scale dataset from a real-world railway application demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, outperforming previous methods."}
