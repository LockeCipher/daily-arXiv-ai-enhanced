Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this field with their strong generation and generalization capabilities. However, several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference and visual artifacts, which arise from the implicit latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), complicating the diffusion process; 2) authentic facial expressions and head movements, resulting from insufficient multi-modal information interaction. In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1) defines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural rendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning process; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately enhancing overall facial expressiveness. Subsequently, a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy is adopted to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring effective integration across feature spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that MoDA significantly improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications."}

Recent works transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression, rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the time-varying neural representation."}

Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial. Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high computational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior visual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering, a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering process.   Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework called~\\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\\times$ while maintaining visual quality."}

We present a method that bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG) renderer.

This can erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover, it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent embeddings for generated image detection.

Current state-of-the-art approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to improve its ability to correct phase logical errors.

To address this, we propose DESign, a novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features, thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally, we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action sequences.

To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple, effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the Forest and the Trees.\" Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis. By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby mitigating its inherent bias.

The interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in order to extract motion information.

We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video.

Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods."}

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency. Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF) framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal."}

However, the slow inference speed and high computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this, we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters count.

To address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching. Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image.

Existing low-light enhancement methods often struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework (RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling. To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview consistency on standard benchmarks.

Despite significant advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains (source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains (target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through cross-modal guided denoising.

The quadratic computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our PromptSR.

Project Page: https://tianfr.github.io/DynamicVoyager", "summary": "This paper studies the problem of generating an unbounded dynamic scene from a single view, which has wide applications in augmented/virtual reality and robotics. Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need to be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated contents can be controlled with scene prompts."}

To address this challenge, we propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image, achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models."}

To improve its performance on real-world data, depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization methods."}

Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features.

CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and semantic injection.

Following a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second, we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference. Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.

A central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both content and style, and that query features predominantly encode content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query blending.

In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

We propose QR-LoRA, a novel fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices while only training an additional task-specific $\\Delta R$ matrix.

To reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that explicitly represents and learns compact topology.

In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability, respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.

Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths."}

However, running these models at sufficient resolution for local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example, data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing inequities in access to high-resolution climate information."}

While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the \\textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity.

We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely entirely on text prompts make the editing process a \"one-shot deal\", making it difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality 3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project $GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later inference.

However, image-based diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation (TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models. Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up.

To better understand the vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference, exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models.

In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp.

For hardware implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption. In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational requirements (< 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments."}

The accuracy depends on the quality of the environment model and its electromagnetic properties. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have made it possible to reconstruct detailed environment models augmented with semantic segmentation labels.   In this letter, we propose a differentiable ray tracing-based radio propagation simulator that operates directly on point clouds. We showcase the efficiency of our method by simulating multi-bounce propagation paths with up to five interactions with specular reflections and diffuse scattering in two indoor scenarios, each completing in less than 90 ms. Lastly, we demonstrate how the differentiability of electromagnetic computations can be combined with segmentation labels to learn the electromagnetic properties of the environment."}

Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial. Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high computational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior visual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering, a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering process.   Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework called~\\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\\times$ while maintaining visual quality."}

In this paper, we proposed a new data quality control pipeline to refine the quality of CT images based on GAN and sliding windows. Also, we use class-sensitive cost functions including Label Distribution Aware Loss(LDAM Loss) and Class-balanced(CB) Loss to solve the long-tail problem existing in datasets. Our model reaches more than 0.983 MCC in the benchmark test dataset."}

Following the simplified linear-motion hypothesis, existing approaches adopt optical flow-based models to interpolate intermediate frames. However, realistic respiratory motions should be nonlinear and quasi-periodic with specific frequencies. Intuited by this property, we resolve the temporal interpolation task from the frequency perspective, and propose a Fourier basis-guided Diffusion model, termed FB-Diff. Specifically, due to the regular motion discipline of respiration, physiological motion priors are introduced to describe general characteristics of temporal data distributions. Then a Fourier motion operator is elaborately devised to extract Fourier bases by incorporating physiological motion priors and case-specific spectral information in the feature space of Variational Autoencoder. Well-learned Fourier bases can better simulate respiratory motions with motion patterns of specific frequencies. Conditioned on starting and ending frames, the diffusion model further leverages well-learned Fourier bases via the basis interaction operator, which promotes the temporal interpolation task in a generative manner. Extensive results demonstrate that FB-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) perceptual performance with better temporal consistency while maintaining promising reconstruction metrics. Codes are available."}

Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation, cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that reflect transcriptomic perturbations."}

Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\\it S}equential {\\it A}ttention-based {\\it S}ampling for {\\it H}istopathological {\\it A}nalysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis.

However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.
