*Souradip Nath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4V在图像取证领域展示了强大的零样本能力，尤其在检测图像拼接方面表现优异，准确率超过85%。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GPT-4V在图像取证中的零样本能力，探索其在检测图像拼接方面的潜力。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（零样本、少样本和思维链）在CASIA v2.0数据集上评估GPT-4V。

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下表现优异，思维链提示在真实和拼接图像间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: GPT-4V虽不及专用模型，但其通用性和推理能力使其成为图像取证中的灵活工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

TL;DR: CarboNeXT是一个用于光学气体成像的语义分割框架，用于检测和量化CO₂排放，在低流量场景下表现优异，并支持实时监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CO₂排放是环境和工业过程的重要指标，特别是在畜牧业管理中，需要高效的工具进行监测和分析。

Method: 结合多尺度上下文聚合网络、UPerHead和辅助FCN组件，提出CarboNeXT框架，并贡献了两个新数据集（CCR和RTA）。

Result: CarboNeXT在CCR和RTA数据集上分别达到88.46%和92.95%的mIoU，实时性能为60.95 FPS；轻量版CarboFormer在资源受限平台上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为CO₂排放分析提供了高效工具，特别适用于畜牧业和环境监测，推动了精准畜牧业的发展。

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

TL;DR: STFlow提出了一种基于流匹配的生成模型，通过建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布来考虑细胞间相互作用，解决了现有方法在内存和独立性预测上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术虽强大，但受限于低通量和实验设施需求。现有预测方法因独立预测和内存问题表现不佳。

Method: STFlow采用流匹配生成模型，建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布，并引入高效的切片级编码器与局部空间注意力机制。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有方法，相对病理基础模型提升超过18%。

Conclusion: STFlow通过建模细胞间相互作用和优化内存使用，显著提升了空间转录组学预测的性能。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.
