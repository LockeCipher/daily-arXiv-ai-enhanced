### [1] [Gen4D: Synthesizing Humans and Scenes in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05397)
*Jerrin Bright,Zhibo Wang,Yuhao Chen,Sirisha Rambhatla,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Gen4D是一个自动化生成多样化、逼真4D人体动画的管道，结合了运动编码、扩散高斯飞溅和背景合成技术，并基于此创建了SportPAL合成数据集，用于解决野外活动数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外活动（如体育）数据不足的问题，现有合成数据集因依赖固定资源库和手工渲染管道而缺乏多样性。

Method: 提出Gen4D管道，结合运动编码、扩散高斯飞溅的提示引导头像生成和人类感知背景合成。

Result: 创建了SportPAL合成数据集，覆盖棒球、冰球和足球三种运动。

Conclusion: Gen4D和SportPAL为野外人体视觉任务提供了无需手工建模的可扩展合成数据基础。

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low
performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets
offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from
limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to
their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and
lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale
synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer.
Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing
synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no
need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.

### [2] [IGSM: Improved Geometric and Sensitivity Matching for Finetuning Pruned Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05398)
*Caleb Zheng,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出IGSM框架，通过二阶雅可比投影损失改进剪枝扩散模型的微调，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪枝扩散模型因容量有限导致质量下降，现有方法仅使用与稠密模型相同的目标微调，未充分利用稠密模型的知识。

Method: 提出IGSM框架，引入基于有限时间李雅普诺夫指数的二阶雅可比投影损失，对齐剪枝与稠密模型的几何和时间动态。

Result: 在多个数据集上，IGSM显著缩小剪枝与稠密模型的性能差距，提升样本质量。

Conclusion: IGSM是一种通用微调框架，适用于多种架构的扩散模型，有效提升剪枝模型的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve realistic outcomes across a wide range of generative
tasks, but their high computational cost remains a major barrier to deployment.
Model pruning has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce inference cost and
enable lightweight diffusion models. While effective, pruned diffusion models
are proned to quality reduction due to limited capacity. A key limitation of
current pruning approaches is that pruned models are finetuned using the same
objective as the dense model, typically denoising score matching (DSM). Since
the dense model is accessible during finetuning, it warrants a more effective
approach for knowledge transfer from the dense to the pruned model. Motivated
by this aim, we revisit the finetuning stage and propose IGSM
(\textbf{I}mproved \textbf{G}eometric and \textbf{S}ensitivity
\textbf{M}atching), a general-purpose finetuning framework that introduces a
second-order Jacobian projection loss inspired by Finite-Time Lyapunov
Exponents (FTLE). IGSM efficiently captures and aligns the geometric and the
temporal dynamics of pruned models with their dense teachers using scalable
second-order projections. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and applies to
both U-Net- and Transformer-based diffusion models. Experiments on CIFAR-10,
CelebA, LSUN-Church, and LSUN-Bedroom show that IGSM consistently narrows the
performance gap between pruned and dense models, substantially improving sample
quality. Code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/FATE4869/IGSM-Official

### [3] [AI-powered Contextual 3D Environment Generation: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05449)
*Miguel Silva,Alexandre Valle de Carvalho*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量3D环境生成在游戏、虚拟现实和电影等行业中至关重要，但依赖人工过程导致资源密集，因此研究生成式AI技术的潜力。

Method: 通过系统综述现有生成式AI技术，分析其特点、优势和局限，并探讨场景真实性、文本输入影响等关键挑战。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such
as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to
the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of
existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their
characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By
examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene
authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to
how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the
impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current
models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for
assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into
their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future
research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced
generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high
computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like
cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the
quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation
metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.

### [4] [ODE-GS: Latent ODEs for Dynamic Scene Extrapolation with 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05480)
*Daniel Wang,Patrick Rim,Tian Tian,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ODE-GS结合3D高斯喷溅与潜在神经ODE，预测动态3D场景，超越训练时间范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染系统（如NeRF或3DGS）在时间外推时性能崩溃，ODE-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 学习时间条件变形模型后冻结，用Transformer编码过去高斯轨迹，通过神经ODE控制潜在状态演化。

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，PSNR提升10 dB，LPIPS减半，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 连续时间潜在动力学是实现复杂3D场景逼真预测的有效途径。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

### [5] [Neural Visibility Cache for Real-Time Light Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05930)
*Jakub Bokšanský,Daniel Meister*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出一种在线训练的神经缓存，用于存储光源与3D位置之间的可见性，结合加权蓄水池采样（WRS）实现实时渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时场景中多光源直接光照的挑战，提升渲染效率。

Method: 使用多层感知机（MLP）和多分辨率哈希网格编码实现神经缓存，支持在线训练和高效推理。

Result: 该方法可无缝集成到现有渲染框架，并与其他实时技术（如ReSTIR）结合使用。

Conclusion: 神经缓存为实时多光源渲染提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of
physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time
scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility
between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir
sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a
fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid
encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in
real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing
rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time
techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).

### [6] [SurGSplat: Progressive Geometry-Constrained Gaussian Splatting for Surgical Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05935)
*Yuchao Zheng,Jianing Zhang,Guochen Ning,Hongen Liao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SurGSplat是一种通过几何约束逐步优化3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的新方法，用于解决内窥镜场景中稀疏特征和不一致光照导致的3D重建问题，提升手术导航的精确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜场景中的稀疏特征和不一致光照使现有基于运动恢复结构（SfM）的方法效果不佳，导致重建失败，需要一种更鲁棒的方法来支持手术导航。

Method: 提出SurGSplat，通过整合几何约束逐步优化3D高斯泼溅（3DGS），实现血管结构等关键特征的详细重建。

Result: 实验表明，SurGSplat在新视角合成（NVS）和姿态估计精度上表现优异，为手术场景重建提供了高保真且高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: SurGSplat通过几何约束优化3DGS，显著提升了内窥镜场景的3D重建质量，为手术决策提供了更清晰的视觉支持。

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic
scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent
lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods
inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints,
we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a
high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More

### [7] [Hardware Accelerated Neural Block Texture Compression with Cooperative Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06040)
*Belcour Laurent,Benyoub Anis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 扩展了神经纹理压缩方法，支持低动态范围块压缩格式，实现更高压缩比或更高质量，并通过基于瓦片的渲染架构提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有神经纹理压缩方法，使其在低动态范围块压缩格式下仍能高效运行，同时提升压缩比或质量。

Method: 利用现有块压缩方法和硬件纹理过滤，结合基于瓦片的渲染架构和硬件矩阵乘法引擎。

Result: 在Intel B580上以28MB VRAM和0.55ms渲染4k纹理集（9通道），支持各向异性过滤。

Conclusion: 低动态范围块压缩格式可行，且能显著提升压缩效率或质量，同时通过硬件优化实现高性能渲染。

Abstract: In this work, we present an extension to the neural texture compression
method of Weinreich and colleagues [2024]. Like them, we leverage existing
block compression methods which permit to use hardware texture filtering to
store a neural representation of physically-based rendering (PBR) texture sets
(including albedo, normal maps, roughness, etc.). However, we show that low
dynamic range block compression formats still make the solution viable. Thanks
to this, we show that we can achieve higher compression ratio or higher quality
at fixed compression ratio. We improve performance at runtime using a tile
based rendering architecture that leverage hardware matrix multiplication
engine. Thanks to all this, we render 4k textures sets (9 channels per asset)
with anisotropic filtering at 1080p using only 28MB of VRAM per texture set at
0.55ms on an Intel B580.

### [8] [Can ChatGPT Perform Image Splicing Detection? A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05358)
*Souradip Nath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4V在图像取证领域展示了强大的零样本能力，尤其在检测图像拼接方面表现优异，准确率超过85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GPT-4V在图像取证中的零样本能力，探索其在检测图像拼接方面的潜力。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（零样本、少样本和思维链）在CASIA v2.0数据集上评估GPT-4V。

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下表现优异，思维链提示在真实和拼接图像间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: GPT-4V虽不及专用模型，但其通用性和推理能力使其成为图像取证中的灵活工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CO₂排放是环境和工业过程的重要指标，特别是在畜牧业管理中，需要高效的工具进行监测和分析。

Method: 结合多尺度上下文聚合网络、UPerHead和辅助FCN组件，提出CarboNeXT框架，并贡献了两个新数据集（CCR和RTA）。

Result: CarboNeXT在CCR和RTA数据集上分别达到88.46%和92.95%的mIoU，实时性能为60.95 FPS；轻量版CarboFormer在资源受限平台上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为CO₂排放分析提供了高效工具，特别适用于畜牧业和环境监测，推动了精准畜牧业的发展。

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

*Tinglin Huang,Tianyu Liu,Mehrtash Babadi,Wengong Jin,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STFlow提出了一种基于流匹配的生成模型，通过建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布来考虑细胞间相互作用，解决了现有方法在内存和独立性预测上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术虽强大，但受限于低通量和实验设施需求。现有预测方法因独立预测和内存问题表现不佳。

Method: STFlow采用流匹配生成模型，建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布，并引入高效的切片级编码器与局部空间注意力机制。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有方法，相对病理基础模型提升超过18%。

Conclusion: STFlow通过建模细胞间相互作用和优化内存使用，显著提升了空间转录组学预测的性能。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

Motivation: CO₂排放是环境和工业过程的关键指标，特别是在畜牧业管理中，需要高效的工具进行实时监测和分析。

Method: 采用多尺度上下文聚合网络与UPerHead和辅助FCN组件结合，提出两个新数据集（CCR和RTA）进行模型训练和评估。

Result: CarboNeXT在CCR和RTA数据集上分别达到88.46%和92.95%的mIoU，实时运行速度为60.95 FPS；轻量版CarboFormer性能接近但更高效。

Conclusion: 该研究为CO₂排放分析提供了高效工具，特别适用于畜牧业和环境监测，轻量版适合资源受限平台。

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STFlow是一种基于流匹配的生成模型，通过建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布来考虑细胞间相互作用，解决了现有方法在内存和独立性预测上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术因低通量和实验设施需求受限，现有预测方法未能有效建模细胞间相互作用且面临内存问题。

Method: 提出STFlow模型，采用流匹配生成方法建模切片级基因表达联合分布，并设计高效的局部空间注意力编码器。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有方法，相对病理基础模型提升超过18%。

Conclusion: STFlow通过改进建模和编码效率，为空间转录组学预测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

*Yui Tatsumi,Ziyue Zeng,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于种子选择的方法，通过从多个候选种子中选择最优种子来提升图像质量，同时不增加比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要额外传输信息以实现可扩展性，而现有扩散方法虽避免了这一点，但使用单一随机种子可能导致图像质量不佳。

Method: 提出种子选择方法，基于反向扩散过程的早期中间输出来选择最优种子，以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了图像质量，且未增加比特率，计算成本较低。

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的文本到立体图像生成方法，利用Stable Diffusion的先验知识并通过微调优化立体一致性和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模立体图像数据集稀缺，直接训练扩散模型不可行，因此利用现有模型的先验知识进行微调。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion微调，引入提示对齐和立体一致性奖励函数优化生成效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样场景中生成高质量立体图像，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过微调和优化策略，有效解决了立体图像生成的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic

novel neural architecture that integrates spatial feature extraction using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal modeling through gated

Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing

Conclusion: 该研究为法医领域提供了检测伪造视频和隐藏犯罪证据的工具，有助于识别犯罪活动。

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence
towards the identification of criminal activities.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

Result: 微软的Swin Transformer在三种ViT模型中表现最佳，支持集规模增加时性能提升。

Conclusion: ViT和ResNet结合的方法在公平性和泛化性上表现良好，为生物特征认证提供了新思路。

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and
data are available at: https://github.com/Sufianlab/FairVitBio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和解释性描述作为独立任务优化，导致模型在评分准确性和解释性之间存在权衡，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动阶段通过专家设计的提示从教师模型蒸馏高质量数据，初始化推理能力；强化学习微调阶段引入新奖励机制（GRPO）联合优化评分准确性和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在质量评分回归基准上达到SOTA性能（SRCC提升6.5%），并在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于基于描述的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: Q-Ponder框架成功解决了评分与解释性的权衡问题，展示了在多任务中的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Result: 在TVSum20和SumMe数据集上，TriPSS表现优于传统单模态和多模态方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TriPSS通过捕捉视觉和语义的细微信息，为大规模视频内容理解设定了新标准。

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分割模型（如SAM和SAM-HQ）在处理复杂形状物体（如细长结构或精细边界）时表现不佳。

Method: 利用用户提供的文本提示生成CLIP嵌入，并将其投影到DINO特征空间，作为SAM-HQ的额外提示。

Result: 在BIG、ThinObject5K和DIS5K基准测试中，Talk2SAM比SAM-HQ提高了5.9%的IoU和8.3%的边界IoU。

Conclusion: 结合自然语言指导是一种灵活且有效的方法，特别适用于传统提示方法失败的情况。

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image

Result: 在Waymo和CODA数据集及真实车辆上验证，最大延迟减少57.58%，检测精度提升44%。

Conclusion: AD-EE有效解决了视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的实时性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,

Motivation: 在机器人科学实验室中，视觉异常检测对于及时发现和解决潜在故障或偏差至关重要，是确保实验过程稳定性和安全性的关键因素。

Method: 提出了一种基于VLM的视觉推理方法，通过四种逐步信息化的提示配置支持不同级别的监督，并构建了一个专门用于科学工作流程中过程异常检测的视觉基准。

Result: 实验表明，随着提供更多上下文信息，检测准确性提高，验证了方法的有效性和适应性。真实场景验证也证实了第一人称视觉观察可以有效识别过程级异常。

Conclusion: 本研究为科学实验工作流程中的视觉异常检测提供了数据驱动的基础和评估框架。

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify
process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and
an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment
workflows.

*Çağlar Hızlı,Çağatay Yıldız,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODIS是一种预训练方法，通过对象级自蒸馏改进视觉表示，解决了图像级自蒸馏在多对象场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉预训练方法假设图像仅含单一对象，但实际场景常含多个对象，限制了方法的扩展性和复杂性。

Method: ODIS通过对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力隔离对象区域，将场景级任务分解为对象级子任务。

Result: ODIS在ViT-Large上实现了82.6%的k-NN准确率，显著提升了图像和补丁级别的视觉表示。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏有效提升了复杂场景下的视觉表示能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大多数视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视线推断任务中表现不佳，仅少数表现优于随机猜测，而人类表现接近完美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在视线推断任务中的能力，以评估其在自然人机交互中的潜力。

Method: 通过控制实验，比较111个VLMs和65名人类参与者在不同难度和变异性照片中的表现，并使用混合效应模型分析行为。

Result: 94个VLMs表现不如随机猜测，人类表现接近完美；少数优秀VLMs表现受任务难度影响，但对感知变化较稳健。

Conclusion: VLMs目前缺乏视线推断能力，但仍有改进潜力，未来可能成为更自然的人机交互技术。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

TL;DR: SAVVY-Bench是首个针对动态场景中3D空间推理的基准测试，结合了同步空间音频。SAVVY提出了一种无需训练的两阶段推理流程，显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AV-LLMs和基准测试主要关注静态或2D场景，缺乏对动态3D空间音频场景的研究，因此需要新的基准和方法。

Method: SAVVY采用两阶段流程：(1) 利用AV-LLMs和其他视听方法跟踪关键对象的轨迹；(2) 构建全局动态地图并通过坐标转换对齐视角以回答问题。

Result: SAVVY显著提升了现有AV-LLMs在动态3D空间推理任务中的性能，设定了新的标准。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY方法为动态3D空间推理提供了新的研究方向和工具，推动了AV-LLMs的发展。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEP格式需要CAD内核处理，限制了其在大型学习流程中的使用，尤其是计算集群上的部署。

Method: 开发了基于HDF5的开放格式和开源Python库，支持数据查询和处理，并转换了Fusion 360和ABC数据集。

Result: 通过四个标准用例（法线估计、去噪、表面重建和分割）验证了数据完整性和与原STEP文件的兼容性。

Conclusion: 提出的HDF5格式和工具解决了STEP格式的限制，为CAD数据在机器学习中的应用提供了便利。

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要高效且鲁棒的图像表示，尤其是在图像包含干扰元素（如阴影、云、光）时，且这些干扰在训练中未暴露时更为重要。

Method: 设计SPD方法，通过并行弱增强和强增强，预测双向增强版本的逆和正向转换来学习表示。

Result: 在MuJoCo视觉控制任务和CARLA自动驾驶任务中，SPD在复杂观察中优于先前研究，显著提升未见观察的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPD方法能高效提取任务相关特征，提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MBRL在视觉干扰（如云、阴影、光线）下性能下降的问题。

Method: 使用双对比学习训练编码器和世界模型，引入递归状态逆动力学模型以更好地理解时间结构。

Result: 在DeepMind Control和Robosuite中，性能分别提升117%和14%。

Conclusion: Dr. G显著提升了MBRL在视觉干扰下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is
open-sourced and available at https://github.com/JeongsooHa/DrG.git

Motivation: 现有RF-based MPPE方法要么预处理复杂耗时，要么直接处理原始信号导致精度低。本文旨在设计一种高效且高精度的解决方案。

Method: 子分组RF信号，使用共享单层CNN嵌入后结合多头注意力；提出自监督学习方法，利用未掩码和掩码子组预测潜在表示。

Result: PCKh@0.5指标提升15%，自监督方法在新场景和障碍物下表现更优，随人数增加性能增益显著。

Conclusion: 模型高效轻量且性能优越，自监督方法增强了泛化能力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

TL;DR: SIV-Bench是一个新的视频基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在社交场景理解、社交状态推理和社交动态预测方面的能力。实验表明，模型在社交状态推理和社交动态预测方面表现较差，尤其是关系推理是主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类社交互动的复杂性和多模态特性对人工智能提出了挑战，需要开发新的评估工具以推动研究进展。

Method: 通过收集2,792个视频片段和8,792个问题-答案对，构建SIV-Bench基准，并分析不同文本提示对模型表现的影响。

Result: 模型在社交场景理解上表现良好，但在社交状态推理和社交动态预测上表现不佳，关系推理是主要瓶颈。转录对话对理解复杂社交互动至关重要。

Conclusion: SIV-Bench为开发更具社交智能的AI提供了关键见解，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了视觉语言模型在多模态对抗攻击下的脆弱性，为提升其鲁棒性提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Conclusion: 该方法在鲁棒性评估中表现出色，适用于实际用例。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Result: CLIP视觉表征提供可直接使用的语义信息；语言解码器在视觉表征不足时可补偿性能。

Conclusion: VLM中存在动态分工，未来可设计更多视觉处理由语言解码器承担的结构。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 结构化数据和轻量模型显著提升自动驾驶决策效率和性能，场景标注对决策任务有重要影响。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote

learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RADAR的新方法，用于可靠地识别图像中被修改的区域，结合了多种图像模态特征和对比损失，显著提高了检测精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在图像编辑中的广泛应用，识别被修改的真实图像变得尤为重要，但现有方法面临新工具的挑战。

Method: RADAR基于现有基础模型，结合不同图像模态特征，并引入辅助对比损失以隔离被修改的图像块。

Result: 实验表明，RADAR在检测和定位图像编辑方面表现优异，优于现有方法，并能泛化到多种扩散模型。

Conclusion: RADAR是一种高效且泛化能力强的图像修改检测方法，BBC-PAIR基准的引入进一步支持了实际评估。

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,
data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.

TL;DR: S2GO提出了一种基于稀疏查询的3D表示方法，通过动态传播查询和解码为语义高斯分布，实现了高效的3D场景预测，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D占用预测方法依赖密集表示，速度慢且缺乏灵活性，无法有效捕捉动态驾驶场景。

Method: 使用紧凑的3D查询集动态传播，并通过解码为语义高斯分布，结合去噪渲染目标优化查询和高斯分布。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI基准测试中表现最佳，IoU提升1.5，推理速度快5.9倍。

Conclusion: 稀疏查询表示在3D场景预测中具有高效性和灵活性，优于传统密集表示方法。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the
dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human
cognition using neural network models.

Motivation: 现有视频修复方法通常针对固定上采样因子训练，无法灵活处理超出训练分布的尺度或退化问题。

Method: 采用分层时空纹理编码框架和多分辨率隐式哈希编码，实现从低分辨率输入到任意放大尺度的高分辨率、去噪帧的自适应解码。

Result: 实验表明，VR-INR在未见尺度和噪声下仍能保持高质量重建，在清晰度、细节保留和去噪效果上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VR-INR展示了隐式神经表示在视频修复任务中的强大泛化能力和灵活性。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Motivation: 现实场景中的反射复杂多样，现有方法难以有效处理，因此需要一种更强大的技术来分离反射和背景。

Method: 采用U形架构，结合FFT Transformer块（利用全局频率信息）和分层Transformer块（多尺度特征提取）。

Result: 在三个公开测试数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: F2T2-HiT架构在SIRR任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: FocusDiff在现有基准上达到最优性能，并在PairComp上显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: FocusDiff通过细粒度对齐改进文本到图像生成，实现了更精确的控制。

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态推理基准在时间复杂性、广泛推理能力和持续进步测量方面存在不足。

Method: 通过程序化生成500个脚本化视频片段，涵盖六类推理问题，结合Python脚本和生成模型。

Result: 实验显示现有先进模型在所有推理类别中表现不佳，尤其在抽象和规划任务上。

Conclusion: MORSE-500提供了一个可扩展的基准，支持未来多模态推理研究的透明性和可重复性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Motivation: 现有基于概念的神经网络解释存在概念不一致问题，且缺乏用户反馈机制，影响解释的可理解性。

Method: 提出YoursProtoP，通过用户监督调整和拆分原型部分（视觉概念），使其更符合用户偏好和理解。

Result: 在FunnyBirds、CUB、CARS和PETS数据集上验证，YoursProtoP在保持模型准确性的同时实现了概念一致性。

Conclusion: YoursProtoP有效解决了概念不一致问题，并通过用户交互提升了模型解释的可理解性。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

Motivation: 现有图像编码器（如DINO或CLIP）缺乏时间感知，而视频模型（如VideoMAE）在密集预测任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种新的视频编码器。

Method: FRAME通过学习从过去和当前RGB帧预测当前和未来的DINO补丁特征，生成时空一致的表示，并利用CLIP的语义空间支持语言驱动任务。

Result: 在六个密集预测任务和七个数据集上，FRAME表现优于图像编码器和现有自监督视频模型。

Conclusion: FRAME是一种紧凑且多功能的视频编码器，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Motivation: 尽管3D技术在静态场景中表现良好，但在动态现象（如移动物体分割）中效果不佳。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为Layered Motion Fusion的方法，将2D模型的运动分割预测融合到分层辐射场中，并通过测试时细化降低数据复杂度。

Result: 该方法显著提升了3D模型的分割性能，超越了2D基线模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，3D技术即使在动态场景中也能有效增强2D分析能力。

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

Result: 方法有效减少了语义幻觉，并在场景文本识别和理解任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架无需训练即可显著改善语义幻觉问题，同时保持对有意义文本的语义理解。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

Conclusion: EX-4D通过创新的几何表示和训练策略，显著提升了极端视角下视频生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartCrafter是一个结构化3D生成模型，能从单张RGB图像联合生成多个语义明确且几何独立的3D网格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么生成单一3D形状，要么采用两阶段流程（先分割图像再重建每个部分），PartCrafter旨在通过统一、组合的生成架构解决这些问题，无需预分割输入。

Method: 基于预训练的3D网格扩散变换器（DiT），引入组合潜在空间和分层注意力机制，支持端到端部分感知生成。

Result: 实验表明，PartCrafter在生成可分解3D网格方面优于现有方法，包括输入图像中不可见的部分。

Conclusion: PartCrafter展示了部分感知生成先验在3D理解和合成中的优势，代码和训练数据将公开。

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UniRes的扩散框架，用于解决复杂退化图像的端到端恢复问题，通过结合多个专用模型，实现了对野外复杂退化图像的高效恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图像恢复面临多种退化问题，现有方法难以泛化到野外数据。本文聚焦于复杂退化（多种已知退化的任意混合），提出了一种解决方案。

Method: 提出UniRes框架，结合多个专用模型在扩散采样步骤中，利用孤立训练数据实现复杂退化恢复。框架灵活，支持扩展和调整保真度-质量权衡。

Result: 在复杂退化和单一退化数据集上评估，实验结果显示性能显著提升，尤其是复杂退化图像。

Conclusion: UniRes框架有效解决了复杂退化图像的恢复问题，具有灵活性和扩展性，适用于现实世界应用。

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Real-SR方法，通过多任务学习框架解决任务不平衡问题，包括任务定义、不平衡量化和自适应数据再平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于低分辨率图像中复杂的退化模式，Real-SR问题具有挑战性，传统方法难以平衡不同退化模式的处理。

Method: 提出了一种新的任务定义框架，通过参数边界分割退化空间，并开发了基于焦点损失的多任务加权机制和自适应数据再平衡策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在所有退化任务中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过任务定义、不平衡量化和数据再平衡的协同改进，实现了Real-SR的优化性能。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的迭代视觉框架，用于开放世界的视觉关系检测（VRD），通过结合LLM生成的关系假设和视觉证据，提升了模型对未标注和新谓词的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统VRD模型依赖固定谓词集、难以泛化到新交互的问题，探索如何利用外部知识（LLM）视觉化未标注的关系假设。

Method: 采用期望最大化（EM）框架，交替使用LLM生成场景图假设（期望步骤）和视觉模型对齐假设与感知证据（最大化步骤）。

Result: 在Visual Genome的新基准测试中，模型在已见、未见和混合谓词分类任务上均优于基线方法（mR@50分别为15.9、13.1和11.7）。

Conclusion: 结合LLM的结构化先验知识，能够有效提升开放世界视觉理解的扩展性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图立体方法在航空图像中表现不佳，主要由于深度范围变化和低细节图像的特征匹配问题。

Method: 提出ADR-MVS，结合单目几何线索生成自适应深度范围图，并通过交叉注意力差异学习优化深度估计。

Result: 在WHU、LuoJia-MVS和München数据集上达到最优性能，计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: ADR-MVS通过自适应深度范围和几何感知改进，显著提升了航空图像的三维重建效果。

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅外组织在MRI中可能对健康评估和临床决策有重要价值，但现有工具未广泛验证，尤其是在发育中大脑或病理情况下。

Method: TissUnet基于155对MRI-CT扫描训练，并在涵盖广泛年龄和脑肿瘤患者的九个数据集中验证。

Result: TissUnet在健康成人和肿瘤患者中均表现优异，Dice系数中位数分别为0.83和0.81，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TissUnet能快速、准确、可重复地分割颅外组织，支持大规模研究。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Result: 实验表明，VLA模型需视觉和语言输入才能准确预测动作，缺失任一输入会显著降低准确性。

Conclusion: DriveAction为自动驾驶中人类化决策提供了新见解和严格基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型缺乏对内容道德维度的理解和推理能力，而这是人类认知的关键方面。

Method: MoralCLIP通过整合视觉和文本道德线索到统一的嵌入空间，并基于多标签数据集Social-Moral Image Database进行训练，设计了道德数据增强策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，明确的道德监督提高了单模态和多模态对道德内容的理解能力。

Conclusion: MoralCLIP为具备道德意识的AI系统奠定了基础，能够识别并与人类道德价值观对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

Motivation: 现有token压缩方法（如剪枝或合并）导致信息丢失且需后训练恢复性能，因此需要一种更通用的方法以减少计算成本并保留信息。

Method: 提出一个多对多的Token Transforming框架，将token压缩统一为显式的矩阵变换，保留更多信息并支持训练免费加速。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更好的计算-性能权衡，显著降低预算并加速推理，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

Conclusion: YOEO方法在实时性和有效性上表现优异，适用于机器人交互任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Motivation: 解决多边形近似评估中Rosin优值计算耗时的问题，探索加权优值是否能替代Rosin优值。

Method: 通过理论分析、实验验证和统计相关性分析（Pearson相关系数）比较两种优值。

Result: 两种优值在理论上独立，实验和统计结果也显示无相关性。

Conclusion: 加权优值无法替代Rosin优值，因为两者评估结果不一致。

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

Result: LVLMs虽然能正确回答关于两种特征的问题，但对真实和虚假错觉的回答相同，表明其可能依赖先验知识而非真实视觉理解。

Conclusion: LVLMs对错觉的识别可能基于先验知识，而非真正的视觉理解能力。数据集公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决传感器数据延迟问题的新方法，通过时间戳偏移和数据增强提升感知系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器数据延迟导致的时间错位会影响自动驾驶车辆感知系统的准确性和安全性。

Method: 采用每点时间戳偏移特征和数据增强策略，模拟真实传感器延迟模式。

Result: 在传感器数据同步和延迟情况下，新方法均表现良好，优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升传感器融合的鲁棒性，适用于多传感器系统。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ)
Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's
perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that
reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and
cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which
leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language
queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining
strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to
augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing
localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves
R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Result: 在四个3D血管分割数据集上的实验证明了DeformCL的有效性和优越性，临床可视化验证了其重要性。

Conclusion: DeformCL为3D血管提取提供了一种更优的连续表示方法，具有显著的临床价值。

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

Motivation: 传统UNet的跳跃连接存在多尺度特征交互不足和信息整合效率低的问题，而现有改进方法未解决这些限制。

Result: 在多个医学图像分割数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提高了特征利用率并减少了网络参数，同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法独立于编码器和解码器架构，适用于各种UNet类网络，为医学图像分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Method: 提出DIF滤波器硬件架构，并在FPGA上实现；使用新发布的高分辨率事件数据集进行评测。

Result: DIF架构在1280x720分辨率下吞吐量达403.39 MEPS，640x480下为428.45 MEPS；AUROC指数为0.844-0.999，优于现有方案。

Conclusion: DIF滤波器在吞吐量和噪声鲁棒性上表现优异，适用于广泛噪声环境。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在适应未见字体时计算成本高且耗时，无法实时定制。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习：先学习从孤立字形提取字体属性，再将其融入自然背景。

Result: FontAdapter无需额外微调即可高质量生成未见字体，支持多种字体定制任务。

Conclusion: FontAdapter是一个高效、多功能的字体定制框架。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

Method: 采用区域感知空间引导和注意力驱动的时间特征融合机制，结合多尺度服装特征和姿态对齐。

Result: 实验表明，ChronoTailor在时空连续性和服装细节保留上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChronoTailor为视频虚拟试穿提供了一种高效且细节保留的解决方案。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Result: 在217名患者的验证集上，32张图像比单张图像显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 多光照条件下的SPAT图像比传统单张图像更准确。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

Result: 实验表明，CryoFastAR在合成和真实数据集上与传统迭代方法相比，质量相当且推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: CryoFastAR为冷冻电镜中的快速从头重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

TL;DR: Domain-RAG是一种无需训练的检索引导图像生成框架，用于跨域少样本目标检测（CD-FSOD），通过背景检索、生成和合成解决域对齐问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在跨域少样本目标检测中难以同时保证视觉真实性和域对齐，Domain-RAG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Domain-RAG分为三个阶段：域感知背景检索、域引导背景生成和前景-背景合成。

Result: 实验表明，Domain-RAG在多个任务中表现优异，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Domain-RAG无需额外训练即可生成高质量、域一致的样本，为CD-FSOD提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 提出一种结合视觉语言模型的高效驾驶框架，以解决传统方法在高层意图生成和低延迟需求之间的平衡问题。

Method: 采用选择性五视图提示、多阶段链式思维推理和基于样条的轨迹后处理技术。

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上训练后，HMVLM以7.7367的评分获得2025年Waymo挑战赛第二名，超越基线2.77%。

Conclusion: HMVLM通过创新的提示和推理流程，显著提升了驾驶决策的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public
baseline by 2.77%.

### [91] [Unleashing the Potential of Consistency Learning for Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05890)
*Yiheng Li,Yang Yang,Zichang Tan,Huan Liu,Weihua Chen,Xu Zhou,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CSCL的新方法，通过捕捉细粒度一致性来提升多模态媒体篡改检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在探索局部内容的细粒度一致性方面不足，导致对篡改细节的感知不充分且结果不可靠。

Method: 建立图像和文本模态的两个分支，每个分支包含两个级联解码器（CCD和SCD），分别捕捉模态内上下文一致性和跨模态语义一致性。

Result: 在DGM4数据集上，CSCL取得了最先进的性能，尤其是在定位篡改内容方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CSCL通过细粒度一致性学习，显著提升了多模态媒体篡改检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的Mask2Former模型，结合可变形注意力和偏移调整策略，用于医学图像分割，显著提升了中小器官的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床应用中至关重要，但现有方法（如Transformer）在中小器官分割上表现不佳且资源消耗大。

Method: 采用Mask2Former模型，引入可变形注意力和偏移调整策略，优化采样点位置，并利用第4特征图提供器官粗定位，辅以FCN辅助头加速训练。

Result: 在HaNSeg和SegRap2023数据集上达到SOTA性能，尤其在中小器官分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了医学图像分割中的资源消耗和中小器官分割难题，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

### [93] [Rethinking Semi-supervised Segmentation Beyond Accuracy: Reliability and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05917)
*Steven Landgraf,Markus Hillemann,Markus Ulrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标RSS，用于综合衡量半监督语义分割模型的准确性、可靠性和鲁棒性，填补了当前评估协议的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督分割评估仅关注准确性，忽视了可靠性和鲁棒性，而这些对安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）至关重要。

Method: 引入Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)，通过调和平均结合预测准确性、校准性和不确定性质量。

Result: 实验表明半监督方法常以可靠性换取准确性，UniMatchV2在鲁棒性上表现良好，但可靠性仍有不足。

Conclusion: 建议采用RSS等综合指标，以更好地满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

TL;DR: FADE是一种无需训练的视频编辑方法，通过频率感知分解利用预训练视频扩散模型的先验知识，实现高质量、时间一致的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像扩散模型难以处理视频动态特性，而现有视频扩散模型计算量大，难以直接应用于编辑任务。

Method: 通过分析视频模型的注意力模式，提出频率感知分解策略和频谱引导调制，优化组件角色并防止信息泄漏。

Result: 实验表明，FADE能生成高质量、真实且时间一致的编辑结果。

Conclusion: FADE为视频编辑提供了一种高效且无需训练的新方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于Transformer的动作生成方法在高保真度、实时性、流式生成和可扩展性方面的挑战。

Method: 结合MoSA-VQ（自适应残差向量量化模块）和RQHC-Transformer（残量化层次因果Transformer），并引入文本条件对齐机制。

Result: 在HumanML3D等数据集上表现优于现有方法，显著提升了实时性和流式生成能力。

Conclusion: MOGO在动作生成质量和效率上均取得了显著进展，适用于实时和零样本场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: Dy3DGS-SLAM是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的SLAM方法，适用于动态场景的单目RGB输入，通过融合光流和深度掩码解决动态干扰，实现了先进的跟踪和渲染性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF或3D高斯泼溅的SLAM方法在动态环境中表现不佳，尤其是仅依赖RGB输入时。Dy3DGS-SLAM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过概率模型融合光流和深度掩码生成动态掩码，设计运动损失约束姿态估计网络，并使用渲染损失消除动态对象的干扰。

Result: Dy3DGS-SLAM在动态环境中实现了先进的跟踪和渲染性能，优于或匹配现有RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM为动态场景的单目RGB输入SLAM提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了全面的框架，指出了当前研究空白，并支持DA方法在农业图像分析中的进一步发展。

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MCA-Bench，一个统一的多模态CAPTCHA基准测试套件，用于评估其安全性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAPTCHA方案多样但缺乏统一的评估基准，无法全面衡量其安全性。

Method: 通过共享的视觉-语言模型框架，为每种CAPTCHA类型微调专门的破解代理，实现跨模态评估。

Result: 实验表明MCA-Bench能有效映射现代CAPTCHA设计的漏洞，并首次定量分析挑战复杂性、交互深度和模型可解性之间的关系。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，提出了三项设计原则和开放挑战，为CAPTCHA加固和社区协作奠定基础。

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

Method: 通过监督微调获取动态模型，并利用动态模型通过弱监督学习和推理时验证两种策略引导世界模型的构建。

Result: 最佳模型在Aurora-Bench上的动作中心图像编辑任务中表现优异，优于现有方法15%（基于GPT4o评估），并在人类评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 动态模型可以有效地引导世界模型的构建，为视觉-语言任务提供了一种新的优化路径。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

Motivation: 现有方法对所有样本使用固定的噪声水平，而研究发现不同样本需要不同的噪声水平，清洁样本应注入较少噪声，反之亦然。

Method: SSNI利用预训练的评分网络估计样本偏离清洁数据分布的程度（评分范数），并通过重加权函数自适应调整每个样本的噪声水平。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K数据集上，SSNI显著提升了现有DBP方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，为不同样本分配不同的噪声水平是基于扩散的净化方法的关键改进方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决从fMRI数据中准确重建复杂视觉刺激的挑战，包括元素密度、多样性和复杂语义信息。

Method: HAVIR包含两个适配器：AutoKL适配器（捕捉拓扑结构）和CLIP适配器（提取语义信息），通过Versatile Diffusion融合生成最终图像。

Result: 实验表明HAVIR在复杂场景中能有效重建视觉刺激的结构和语义信息，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR为神经科学与计算机视觉的桥梁提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

Motivation: 现代深度学习应用中，图像和高阶张量数据的高维度需要次二次计算成本的层，而现有方法难以满足需求。

Method: 利用“角树”数学工具，提出了一种线性成本的张量到张量层（FIS层），并推广了迭代积分（或求和）的多参数签名。

Result: 在分类和异常检测任务中表现良好，替换ResNet部分层后精度接近（仅差0.1%），且参数和计算量减少；异常检测模型在MVTec AD数据集上AUROC达97.3%。

Conclusion: FIS层是一种高效且通用的张量处理层，适用于多种任务，并能与其他层无缝集成。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

*Taoran Yue,Xiaojin Lu,Jiaxi Cai,Yuanping Chen,Shibing Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种浅层-深层协同检测网络（SDS-Net），通过双分支架构和自适应特征融合模块，提升红外小目标检测的精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法忽视浅层与深层特征的异质性，导致特征协作不足，影响检测性能和计算成本。

Method: SDS-Net采用双分支架构分别建模结构特征和语义特征，并引入自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征关联。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，SDS-Net优于现有方法，同时保持低计算复杂性和高推理效率。

Conclusion: SDS-Net展示了优越的检测性能和广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的框架，用于在医学图像分析中适应和校准预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs），通过全适应校准和SS-Text方法提升性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在医学图像分析中表现出强大的判别能力，但其可靠性问题尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出全适应校准框架，结合SS-Text方法，通过少量样本适应和校准预训练模型。

Result: 在9个适应任务中，框架在保持相同覆盖保证的同时，将集合效率提高了27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为医学图像分析中VLMs的可靠性和效率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WisWheat是一个针对小麦管理的三层次数据集，显著提升了视觉语言模型在小麦管理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小麦管理依赖人工专家检查，成本高且难以扩展；现有视觉语言模型缺乏领域知识，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出WisWheat数据集，包含预训练、定量测量和指令微调三个层次，用于增强模型在小麦管理任务中的能力。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5 VL 7B模型在小麦压力和生长阶段任务中分别达到79.2%和84.6%的准确率，优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: WisWheat数据集有效提升了视觉语言模型在小麦管理任务中的性能，为农业智能化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

*Koulischer Felix,Handke Florian,Deleu Johannes,Demeester Thomas,Ambrogioni Luca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FBG（FeedBack Guidance）是一种基于反馈的动态引导方法，优于CFG（Classifier-Free Guidance），在ImageNet512x512和文本生成任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG在条件扩散模型中虽然能提高样本保真度，但可能损害多样性和导致记忆化，因为它采用固定引导系数。

Method: FBG通过状态相关系数动态调整引导量，基于条件信号的信息性反馈，假设条件分布被无条件分布线性污染。

Result: 在ImageNet512x512上显著优于CFG，与LIG（Limited Interval Guidance）竞争，且在文本生成中能自动适应不同复杂度的提示。

Conclusion: FBG挑战了引导作为固定超参数的观点，提供了更强的数学框架，并能与现有引导方案结合。

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

TL;DR: VideoChat-A1是一种新型长视频代理范式，通过链式镜头推理逐步选择相关镜头，实现高效长视频理解，性能优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中因忽略镜头结构而表现不佳，需模仿人类逐步思考过程以提升性能。

Method: 采用链式镜头推理范式，逐步选择相关镜头并进行粗到细的分区多模态推理。

Result: 在主流长视频QA基准测试中表现优异，如VideoMME（77.0）和EgoSchema（70.1），优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1通过模仿人类思考过程，显著提升了长视频理解的性能，且效率更高。

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双向引导的低光图像增强框架（BiLIE），通过频率高通滤波和双向交叉注意力融合机制，解决了传统方法中全局低频噪声和局部结构不连续的问题，并提供了新数据集RELIE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧相机在极低光条件下存在动态范围和时间分辨率限制，导致图像细节丢失和运动模糊；现有事件引导的低光增强方法忽略了全局低频噪声和稀疏事件数据的局部结构不连续性。

Method: 提出BiLIE框架，包括事件特征增强（EFE）模块和双向交叉注意力融合（BCAF）机制，分别抑制低频噪声和局部结构不连续。

Result: BiLIE在PSNR和LPIPS指标上分别优于现有方法0.96dB和0.03。

Conclusion: BiLIE有效解决了低光图像增强中的噪声和结构不连续问题，并通过新数据集RELIE提升了实验验证的可靠性。

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量向量化输入和计算密集的Transformer架构，实际应用中难以实现。

Method: 提出基于卷积操作的CCLSTM架构，通过紧凑的循环卷积结构捕捉时空动态。

Result: CCLSTM在占用流指标上达到SOTA，并在Waymo挑战赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: CCLSTM是一种高效、轻量的解决方案，适用于实际自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy
and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

Motivation: 在线视频内容多模态特性导致传统独立检索方法效果不佳，需动态选择最佳模态组合以提升检索性能。

Method: 提出CLaMR，联合编码视频帧、语音转录、屏幕文本和元数据，通过多模态骨干网络和模态感知损失训练动态模态选择。

Result: 在MultiVENT 2.0++和MSRVTT测试集上，CLaMR显著优于基线方法，nDCG@10提升25.6和35.4。

Conclusion: CLaMR在多模态视频检索中表现优异，动态模态选择策略有效提升性能，适用于长视频问答等下游任务。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度作物分类对精准农业和粮食安全监测至关重要，但目前结合高光谱和多时相数据的研究较少，主要受限于数据获取和标注成本。

Method: 构建了H2Crop数据集，结合EnMAP高光谱数据和Sentinel-2时间序列，提出双流Transformer架构，分别处理光谱-空间和时间信息，并通过层次分类头实现多级分类。

Conclusion: 高光谱数据在作物分类中具有显著优势，提出的方法为细粒度分类提供了新基准，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time

previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online

HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that

learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and

Conclusion: STSBench为开发更鲁棒和可解释的自动驾驶VLMs提供了关键工具，强调了时空推理架构改进的紧迫性。

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 该研究为心理图像检索任务提供了新的数据集和方法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic

refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully

TL;DR: 该研究评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在内窥镜任务中的表现，发现其在基础感知任务中表现良好，但在需要医学知识的任务中表现不佳，且专业医学VLMs表现不如通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在内窥镜手术任务中的能力，填补传统计算机视觉模型在此领域的不足。

Method: 使用多种先进模型、手术数据集和人工标注，评估VLMs在基础感知和高级场景理解任务中的表现。

Result: VLMs在基础任务中表现良好，但在医学知识任务中表现显著下降；专业医学VLMs表现不如通用模型。

Conclusion: 需进一步优化VLMs以适应手术环境的复杂性，为下一代内窥镜AI系统提供改进方向。

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种优化GeoTIFF数据加载的方法，显著提升了云存储和本地SSD的加载吞吐量，使GPU利用率大幅提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PyTorch数据加载器在从云存储直接读取GeoTIFF文件时无法充分利用现代GPU的问题。

Method: 通过系统测试不同加载配置和数据参数，使用贝叶斯优化找到云存储和本地SSD的最佳设置。

Result: 优化配置使远程数据加载吞吐量提升20倍，本地吞吐量提升4倍，GPU利用率达到85-95%。

Conclusion: 优化的远程加载配置在相同时间内达到与本地训练相同的精度，验证IoU提升6-15%。

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization
versus 0-30% with standard configurations. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Visual Graph Arena（VGA）数据集，用于评估和改进AI系统在视觉抽象能力上的表现，发现当前模型在视觉理解上存在根本性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前多模态大语言模型在视觉问答中缺乏‘概念化’能力的问题，即无法识别和推理同一概念的不同视觉形式。

Method: 通过VGA数据集中的六个基于图的任务，测试AI系统在不同视觉形式下的推理能力，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 实验显示人类表现接近完美，而AI模型在部分任务中完全失败，表现出伪智能模式匹配而非真正理解。

Conclusion: VGA为AI视觉模型的进步提供了框架，突显了当前模型在视觉理解上的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

Motivation: 现有方法在重建可重光照的头部化身时存在高成本和性能限制，需要一种更高效且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 提出低成本光照舞台捕捉系统，收集多视角、多光照和表情的数据集；基于3D高斯基元构建可重光照化身，结合参数化头部模型和表情动态模块；提出混合神经着色方法，结合神经漫反射BRDF和解析高光项。

Conclusion: BecomingLit在重光照和重演任务中表现优异，为高质量头部化身重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable,
high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at
interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture
setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we
collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous
subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By
leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a
parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a
new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a
significant margin.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在长视频理解方面存在局限，现有基准多关注细节或依赖自动生成问题，无法反映真实理解。

Method: 引入MF$^2$基准，包含50多部电影及其手动构建的真假声明对（共850对），采用二元评估协议。

Result: 实验显示当前开放权重和闭源模型均远低于人类表现，表明模型在核心叙事信息理解和推理能力上的不足。

Conclusion: MF$^2$揭示了当前VLMs在长视频理解上的短板，强调了人类在叙事信息保留和推理上的优势。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Motivation: 解决归一化流在高分辨率图像合成中的可扩展性和性能问题，结合Transformer和归一化流的优势。

Method: 1. 使用深度-浅层Transformer设计；2. 在预训练自编码器的潜在空间建模；3. 引入新的引导算法提升样本质量。

Result: 在类别条件和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，接近扩散模型的样本质量。

Conclusion: STARFlow首次证明了归一化流在大规模高分辨率任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level
understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains
3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities
in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed
candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level
understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art
VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert
performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only
44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human

Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型（LVLM）继承了大型语言模型（LLM）的架构设计，导致视觉信息处理存在缺陷，如注意力分配不均和2D结构关系丢失。

Method: 提出CoMemo双路径架构（Context图像路径和Memory路径）和RoPE-DHR位置编码机制（基于缩略图的位置聚合）。

Result: 在七个基准测试（包括长上下文理解、多图像推理和视觉问答）中表现优于传统LVLM架构。

Conclusion: CoMemo和RoPE-DHR有效解决了LVLM中的视觉信息处理问题，提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Conclusion: 低差异像素选择策略在图像重建中表现更优，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet在胎儿超声图像分类中因单向特征传递和缺乏上下文关联而效果不佳，需解决低对比度、高相似性和高噪声问题。

Method: 设计位置注意力机制（DAN）和双向多尺度信息融合模块（FPAN），增强特征表示和全局依赖。

Result: FPDANet在Top-1和Top-5指标上分别达到91.05%和100%。

Conclusion: FPDANet有效且鲁棒，解决了胎儿超声图像分类的挑战。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

TL;DR: LinGuinE是一种自动化方法，用于分割肺部肿瘤的纵向CT扫描数据，通过初始输入和点传播实现分割，显著提高了Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动化或半自动化的纵向肿瘤分割方法，而这对放疗、手术和化疗评估至关重要。

Method: LinGuinE通过刚性配准传播初始肿瘤点，使用点击有效性分类器筛选有效点，生成新时间点的分割。

Result: 在两个测试数据集上，LinGuinE将Dice分数提高了20%以上（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: LinGuinE在纵向肿瘤分割中表现优异，且可以从任意时间点开始，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

TL;DR: DermaCon-IN是一个来自南印度门诊的皮肤病数据集，包含5450张临床图像，覆盖240种诊断，旨在解决现有数据集的不足，推动公平且鲁棒的皮肤病AI模型发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤病数据集未能捕捉真实世界中的临床和人口复杂性，如地区特异性疾病分布、肤色多样性和非西方人群的不足。

Method: 引入DermaCon-IN数据集，包含5450张图像，由认证皮肤科医生标注，使用基于病因的分类法，并测试多种模型架构（卷积、Transformer、概念瓶颈模型）。

Result: 数据集捕捉了印度门诊常见的皮肤病谱和肤色变化，为未来可解释且临床现实的模型提供了基准性能。

Conclusion: DermaCon-IN为皮肤病AI在真实世界中的发展提供了可扩展且具代表性的基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a
scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in
real-world settings.

Motivation: 忆阻器储层计算系统因其简化训练和动态特性受到关注，但高性能的实现仍受限于预处理方法和储层规模，缺乏对这些因素影响的全面评估。

Method: 系统比较了多种预处理方法对忆阻RC系统的影响，并提出了一种基于奇偶校验的预处理方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了预处理策略对提升忆阻RC系统效率和可扩展性的重要性。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent
neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its
last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors,
RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for
reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based
RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing
method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation
that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper
systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC
systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also
propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6%
while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other
methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing
strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.

Motivation: 解决脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在图像分类和目标检测等任务中表现不及人工神经网络（ANNs）的问题，提升其信息表达能力。

Method: 采用整数二进制泄漏积分发放（Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire）和范围对齐策略，扩展虚拟时间步长并解决高整数激活限制。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到74.19%准确率，COCO上66.2% mAP@50和49.1% mAP@50:95，性能超越同类SNNs，能效提升6.3倍。

Conclusion: 新型脉冲神经元显著提升SNNs性能，接近或超越ANNs，同时保持高能效，为SNNs的实际应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and
energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the
limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking
neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to
exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons
with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%
and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance
with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by
6.3${\times}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消息传递图神经网络（GNNs）的局部归纳偏差限制了其对关键结构信息（如连通性和循环）的利用，PE和PH是两种潜在的解决方案，但缺乏理论比较。

Method: 通过理论分析比较PE和PH的表达能力，提出了一种新的可学习方法PiPE，结合了两者的优势。

Result: PiPE在表达能力上优于PE和PH，并在分子属性预测、图分类和分布外泛化等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PiPE为图表示学习提供了更强大的工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of

Result: 实验显示，RETENTION框架将空间效率提升4.35×至207.12×，精度损失低于3%。

Conclusion: RETENTION为树模型加速提供了高效资源利用的解决方案。

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based

Motivation: 现有方法通常将所有网络参数视为同等重要，忽略了不同层可能编码不同类型信息的特点。

Method: 通过学习参数重要性权重，无需标记数据，使归属过程适应模型结构，捕捉训练数据对输出不同语义方面（如主题、风格或背景）的贡献。

Result: 方法在扩散模型中提高了归属准确性，并提供了对输出如何从训练数据中借鉴的细粒度洞察。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模参数重要性，改进了生成模型中的数据归属分析。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Conclusion: 数据中心方法是AI发展的关键，DSD为商业和多模态AI提供了高质量数据基础。

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Method: 提出一种测试时优化方法，考虑噪声影响以生成更可靠的置信度估计。

Result: 新方法在AUSE和AURC等风险指标上表现优异，能有效区分分布内外样本，并揭示CNN与ViT分类器的关键差异。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了不确定性估计的可靠性，适用于多种视觉数据集。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Conclusion: 当前机器学习模型能够设计非侵入性、视觉传递的神经元级神经干预。

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the
brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in
neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on
one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural
populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and
biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural
sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of
experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied
on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that
current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design
noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at
the resolution of individual neurons.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为上下文记忆智能（CMI）的新范式，旨在解决生成式AI系统中的记忆限制问题，通过结构化捕捉和推理上下文，提升系统的长期一致性、可解释性和决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI系统在组织中广泛应用，但其记忆组件（如RAG、向量存储等）仍存在局限性，导致重复错误和决策不透明。CMI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CMI将记忆重新定位为自适应基础设施，结合认知科学、组织理论和AI治理，提出Insight Layer架构，通过人机协作、漂移检测和理由保存实现上下文记忆。

Result: CMI能够使系统基于数据、历史、判断和动态上下文进行推理，填补当前AI架构的盲点，提升系统效能和社会责任。

Conclusion: CMI为构建高效、可审计且社会责任的智能系统提供了框架，增强人机协作和生成式AI设计的韧性。

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly
implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in
memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems
still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or
reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated
errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory
Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent
systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for
longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather
than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,
human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured
capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system
capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this
vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift
detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into
systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,
judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in
current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating
intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially
responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,
generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing
real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These
systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming
visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and

these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key
contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that
synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset,
a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we
develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive
human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming
video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating
novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This
work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants
capable of guiding users through diverse tasks. Project page:

TL;DR: MLLM-CL是一个新的多模态大语言模型持续学习基准，解决了动态场景中知识整合的挑战，通过参数隔离和路由机制显著减少遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在动态场景中持续整合新知识和技能的能力不足，现有持续学习方法和基准存在局限。

Method: 提出参数隔离防止灾难性干扰，并设计基于MLLM的路由机制。

Result: 实验表明该方法能最小化遗忘，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLLM-CL为多模态持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究开放性和创造性推理能力，填补现有基准测试在复杂、多步谜题上的空白。

Method: 构建PuzzleWorld基准，包含详细标注的谜题、解决方案和推理痕迹，用于评估和诊断模型性能。

Result: 最佳模型仅解决14%的谜题，微调推理痕迹可提升步进推理能力。

Conclusion: PuzzleWorld揭示了当前模型的局限性，为未来开发更通用的推理系统提供支持。

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经隐式表示的实时声学传输方法，解决了动态场景中声学效果变化的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预计算和存储数据，难以应对动态变化的复杂场景，如物体位置、材质和尺寸的变化。

Method: 使用神经隐式表示编码预计算的声学传输及其变化，结合快速蒙特卡洛边界元方法（BEM）和GPU加速的标准BEM生成训练数据。

Result: 方法在数值精度和运行时效率（30秒音频仅需几毫秒）上表现优异，适用于动态环境中的声学建模。

Conclusion: 该方法为虚拟现实、增强现实等交互应用提供了高效准确的声学建模方案。

Abstract: Previous acoustic transfer methods rely on extensive precomputation and
storage of data to enable real-time interaction and auditory feedback. However,
these methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in
object position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These
continuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions,
making it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render
efficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic
Transfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to
encode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time
prediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate
the training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast
Monte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general
scenarios with smooth Neumann conditions. Additionally, we implemented a
GPU-accelerated version of standard BEM for scenarios requiring higher
precision. These methods provide the necessary training data, enabling our
neural network to accurately model the sound radiation space. We demonstrate
our method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several
milliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in
diverse acoustic transfer scenarios. Our approach allows for efficient and
accurate modeling of sound behavior in dynamically changing environments, which
can benefit a wide range of interactive applications such as virtual reality,
augmented reality, and advanced audio production.

Abstract: Traditional soil sampling and analysis methods are labor-intensive,
time-consuming, and limited in spatial resolution, making them unsuitable for

performance was validated through extensive field trials at a large-scale
Australian farm. Experimental results show that the SAS can consistently
acquire soil samples with a mass of 50g at a depth of 200mm, while the Lab can

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本物体导航在未知开放环境中因忽视高维隐式场景信息和长距离目标搜索任务而导致性能显著下降。

Method: 通过EAM利用SBERT和Diffusion推理环境信息，并结合MHR进行前沿探索决策，优化路径效率。

Result: EAM在MP3D数据集上达到64.5%的场景映射准确率，导航任务在HM3D和MP3D基准上的SPL分别为28.4%和26.3%，比基线方法分别提高了21.4%和46.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了零样本物体导航的成功率和效率。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Motivation: 机器人操作任务缺乏统一且大规模的数据集，阻碍了通用操作技能的学习。人类通过理解物体在3D空间中的运动来指导操作，这一思路适用于不同机器人。

Method: 合成3D光流数据集ManiFlow-110k，使用视频扩散模型学习操作物理，生成基于语言指令的3D光流轨迹，并通过GPT-4o评估预测结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样化机器人操作任务中具有强泛化能力，且无需硬件特定训练即可实现跨机器人适配。

Conclusion: 3D光流世界模型为机器人操作提供了一种通用且鲁棒的解决方案，支持跨机器人任务执行。

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

TL;DR: QualitEye是一种验证基于图像的视线数据质量的方法，通过语义表示和隐私保护协议实现高效验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视线数据收集面临数据质量和隐私问题，需要一种既能验证质量又能保护隐私的方法。

Method: QualitEye采用新的语义表示方法，结合公开和隐私保护两种设置，利用私有集合交集协议。

Result: 在MPIIFaceGaze和GazeCapture数据集上验证性能高，隐私保护版本运行时开销小。

Conclusion: QualitEye为机器学习、人机交互和密码学交叉领域的新视线分析方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

TL;DR: WoundAIssist是一款AI驱动的移动应用，通过远程监测和视频咨询支持慢性伤口护理，提升患者生活质量并减轻医疗负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口在老龄化人群中日益普遍，传统护理方式资源密集且效率低，亟需一种患者友好、高效的远程解决方案。

Method: 开发了WoundAIssist应用，结合轻量级深度学习模型进行伤口分割，并通过患者拍照和问卷实现远程监测。

Result: 用户研究表明，应用具有优秀的可用性、良好的质量，且AI伤口识别功能受到积极评价。

Conclusion: WoundAIssist填补了患者与医疗专业人员之间的远程护理空白，并为类似数字健康工具提供了设计参考。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级防御框架Robust Instruction Tuning，通过仅微调适配器模块和文本嵌入层，结合输入多样性和异常激活正则化，有效抵御LVLMs的后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御技术无法适应LVLMs的冻结视觉编码器和核心LLM参数不可修改的限制，且缺乏对未知触发模式或目标响应的先验知识。

Method: 设计了Robust Instruction Tuning框架，结合输入多样性正则化和异常激活正则化，仅微调适配器和文本嵌入层。

Result: 在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上对七种攻击的实验中，攻击成功率降至接近零，训练成本增加不到15%。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需核心权重或攻击先验的情况下，显著提升了LVLMs对后门攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning
framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across
resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local
models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a
quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy
protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31%
accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy
constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most
significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters
than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy
decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent
client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining
efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis
confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01)
under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.
