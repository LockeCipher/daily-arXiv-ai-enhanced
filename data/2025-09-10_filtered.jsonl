A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem.

Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965 resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias, generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting accountability and fairness in AI development."}

We use both traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on their impact on Na\\\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods. Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness. Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2 datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\\%. In contrast, GAN-based techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\\%.

Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity.

However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter (LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components. Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images, enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely 69k multi-view instances.

Our multi-stage pipeline first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under photometric supervision.   While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction.

Typically, LR scans are analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution (HR) data.

Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature. One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU.

These synthetic views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation, such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention to safety-critical tasks.
