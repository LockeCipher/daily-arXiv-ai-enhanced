However, achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures, followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices. Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.", "AI": {"tldr": "LighthouseGS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u624b\u6301\u8bbe\u5907\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a84\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u8986\u76d6\u6574\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002LighthouseGS\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5168\u666f\u5f0f\u624b\u6301\u62cd\u6444\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7c97\u7565\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u9762\u652f\u67b6\u7ec4\u88c5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLighthouseGS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5149\u7167\u771f\u5b9e\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "LighthouseGS\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5168\u666f\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u624b\u6301\u8bbe\u5907\u62cd\u6444\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Feature-based methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions, controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced: rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and adaptability.

CorrDetail is meticulously designed to rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning, with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated, supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCorrDetail\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f2a\u9020\u7ec6\u8282\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9762\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u51fa\u73b0\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f2a\u9020\u7ec6\u8282\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CorrDetail\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6821\u6b63\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u9020\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u878d\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCorrDetail\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4f2a\u9020\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CorrDetail\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to distinguish between high- and low-quality images.

The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model\".

Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes. For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just 15 seconds.

Traditional methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms, suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant advantages in data efficiency.

Designers usually organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers, influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods (e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer. Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background, and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Accordion\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u867d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u80fd\u542f\u53d1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u6587\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SAM\u548c\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u9664\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6307\u5bfc\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728DesignIntention\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5230\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u6dfb\u52a0\u6587\u672c\u5230\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "Accordion\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples, computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared, higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local mode-seeking mechanism, acting as \"collective wisdom\", steers samples away from spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with various diffusion samplers.

To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across images.

This broad definition of brain lesions includes areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain. This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis.

To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation.

Although vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations. Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT) to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos, unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal training data.

Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent fidelity.

However, sensor synchronization challenges often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly, under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates. This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity.

However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation, we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bc6\u96c63D\u7279\u5f81\u4f53\u79ef\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u4f53\u7d20\u5360\u7528\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u4ec5\u5728\u5360\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u6e32\u67d3\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c1150\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u652f\u6301512^3\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

However, the consistent disadvantage of these models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets, such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6GCDA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548cOCR\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u4e14\u62fc\u5199\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u521b\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "GCDA\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u6d41\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548cOCR\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u3001\u907f\u514d\u5931\u771f\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002", "result": "GCDA\u5728MARIO-10M\u548cT2I-CompBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff080.08\uff09\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff080.15\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08FID: 14.3\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GCDA\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548cOCR\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Previous methods rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs) driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes.

Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omni-Video\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Omni-Video\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u5934\u4e0eMLLMs\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8fde\u63a5\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff1b2) \u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5feb\u901f\u8fde\u63a5MLLMs\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Omni-Video\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, when involving generating multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images, resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

Standard diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT, and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference, the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory, allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain, effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and 10% gain in SSIM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08PWD\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u89d2\u5ea6CT\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u89d2\u5ea6CT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u8df3\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u635f\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "PWD\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60LACT\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5229\u7528LACT\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPWD\u4ec5\u970050\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\uff0cPSNR\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c111.7 dB\uff0cSSIM\u63d0\u534710%\u3002", "conclusion": "PWD\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

An improvement exceeding 15 dB in both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging, denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI).

However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose 3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation. Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads, boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b63DGS-LSR\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u76eeRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2dGNSS\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u5730\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea63DGS\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SuperPoint\u548cSuperGlue\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c3DGS-LSR\u5728\u57ce\u9547\u9053\u8def\u3001\u6797\u836b\u5927\u9053\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u96c6\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.026m\u30010.029m\u548c0.081m\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "3DGS-LSR\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728GNSS\u5931\u6548\u7684\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG. NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG. Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably, NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research.

Existing deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings, overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT). LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising: Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs. Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to advance LDCT denoising.
