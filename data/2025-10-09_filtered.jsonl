Various model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three different datasets.

The AI model architecture used in this thesis is based on an earlier work by Lian et al.

In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual information.

Although graph-based methods offer greater representational adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components. First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features, SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency.

Moreover, a mutually reinforcing cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising. This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise, intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises, including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises.

To address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts.

Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence, improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet.

One key challenge in long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1) enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15% to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track different individuals in the captions of long videos."}

Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream segmentation tasks. The code is available here."}

Nevertheless, current methods primarily concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis."}

Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress, recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift, leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance, with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing diffusion-based methods often fail."}

Existing solutions, such as fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness. Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts. Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration. Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy.

Unlike existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers 164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director, orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning."}

This raises a key question: How do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers. Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation. We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations validate our design choices.

Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views. Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views. WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation, which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap."}

Project page: https://pixel-perfect-depth.github.io/", "summary": "This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent space, which inevitably introduces \\textit{flying pixels} at edges and details. Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation."}

However, catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge, remains a major obstacle. Recent incremental learning frameworks with knowledge distillation partially mitigate forgetting but rely heavily on generative replay or auxiliary storage. Meanwhile, diffusion models have proven effective for refining tumor segmentations, but have not been explored in incremental learning contexts. We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the first framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental learning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate synthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new tasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge distillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention. Experiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff consistently outperforms prior methods. It achieves the highest Dice scores of 95.8\\%, 94.9\\%, and 94.6\\%, along with the lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7 mm, and 4.9 mm, respectively. These results indicate that SER-Diff not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also delivers more accurate and anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets."}

While undersampling strategies can accelerate image acquisition, they often result in image artifacts and degraded quality. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for reconstructing high-fidelity images from undersampled data by learning powerful image priors; however, most existing approaches either (i) rely on unsupervised score functions without paired supervision or (ii) apply data consistency only as a post-processing step. In this work, we introduce a conditional denoising diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction, which differs from prior methods by embedding the measurement model directly into every reverse diffusion step and training the model on paired undersampled-ground truth data. This hybrid design bridges generative flexibility with explicit enforcement of MRI physics. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning and diffusion-based methods in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS, with LPIPS capturing perceptual improvements more faithfully. These results demonstrate that integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism, establishing a principled and practical advance toward robust, accelerated MRI reconstruction."}

Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform \"zero-shot super-resolution,\" namely to enable a model to serve inference on higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution (i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust multi-resolution generalization."}
