Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction, which effectively balances rendering quality, efficiency, and speed. However, existing 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face significant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as incomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To address these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization framework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting and 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach divides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling targeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global structural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through voxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate geometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate lighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D wavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance variations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail reconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global structure. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, surpassing existing approaches and advancing the field of 3D scene reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模时间依赖模拟数据的可视化需要大量资源，现有方法注重重建质量而非交互探索。

Method: 利用可变形3D高斯表示动态场景，结合视图无关颜色和亲和力场网络实现精确分割与跟踪。

Result: 在多个时变数据集上验证了有效性，实时交互和低计算需求优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VolSegGS为时变体积数据分析和可视化提供了高效解决方案，拓展了交互探索的可能性。

Abstract: Visualization of large-scale time-dependent simulation data is crucial for domain scientists to analyze complex phenomena, but it demands significant I/O bandwidth, storage, and computational resources. To enable effective visualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis techniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate novel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on reconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization exploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a novel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and tracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and analysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic volumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate segmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for coarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network for fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results within the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous tracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against state-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in real time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS offers a powerful solution under low computational demands. This framework unlocks exciting new possibilities for time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization.

### [3] [Reconstruct, Inpaint, Finetune: Dynamic Novel-view Synthesis from Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12646)
*Kaihua Chen,Tarasha Khurana,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D重建和2D视频扩散模型的新视角合成方法，显著优于现有技术。

Result: CogNVS在动态场景新视角合成中表现优于大多数现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督和零样本适应，实现了高效且高质量的动态场景新视角合成。

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos. Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2) hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic scenes from monocular videos.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality, yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population, which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS). Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under metabolic stress. By linking detailed   vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust, non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular healthcare.

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media, gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

Conclusion: Think-Before-Draw框架显著提升了情感化头部生成的自然性和表现力，为多模态人机交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence, with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts, oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our model's zero-shot generation capability.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators, effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise. Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReToM是一种新的令牌合并策略，通过定义局部边界和选择代表性令牌，提高了图像生成模型的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Stable Diffusion等图像生成模型中注意力操作的二次复杂度问题，同时保持视觉质量。

Method: 提出局部代表性令牌引导合并（ReToM），通过定义窗口边界和选择最具代表性的令牌来合并令牌。

Result: 实验显示ReToM在FID上提升6.2%，CLIP分数更高，同时保持推理时间。

Conclusion: ReToM在视觉质量和计算效率之间取得了有效平衡。

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image, but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time. We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality and computational efficiency.

Result: 在W4A6和W4A8等低比特宽度下显著优于现有方法，保持高质量图像生成和模型稳定性。

Conclusion: DMQ方法有效解决了扩散模型量化中的关键问题，为资源受限环境提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers, leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability.

Conclusion: LoViC在长视频生成中表现出色，兼具一致性和扩展性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

### [12] [RGB Pre-Training Enhanced Unobservable Feature Latent Diffusion Model for Spectral Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12967)
*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于预训练RGB扩散模型的两阶段方法，用于从RGB图像重建高光谱图像（HSI），通过分离不可观测特征并建模其分布，实现了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像重建（SR）的关键难点在于从RGB图像中估计不可观测的光谱特征，这些特征包含RGB传感器未捕获的重要信息。

Method: 扩展RGB预训练的潜在扩散模型（RGB-LDM）为不可观测特征LDM（ULDM），通过两阶段流程（光谱结构表示学习和光谱-空间联合分布学习）实现。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在SR和下游任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过分离不可观测特征并利用RGB预训练模型的空间知识，该方法有效解决了SR问题，并在多个任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation, with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256 steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with 775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/synbol/MaskGIL.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

TL;DR: DiffOSeg是一个基于扩散的两阶段框架，旨在同时实现共识驱动和偏好驱动的医学图像分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中注释变异性问题严重，传统方法无法捕捉注释者偏见，现有方法仅关注单一视角。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段通过概率共识策略建立共识，第二阶段通过自适应提示捕捉专家偏好。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI和NPC-170数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffOSeg能够同时满足共识和偏好需求，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic ``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven (reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning, severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution. Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities. Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images, employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

Conclusion: 生成式AI在解决DNN训练数据稀缺方面具有潜力，但也存在局限性。

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection, leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000 different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively. Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds. These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in addressing DNN training data scarcity.

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation, ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes, creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training, and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness. Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models, and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

Motivation: 观察到预训练ViT的权重矩阵具有近似正交性，而低秩适应矩阵（如LoRA和Adapter）缺乏这一特性。正交性可降低泛化误差上界，因此希望微调后的低秩矩阵也能具备这一特性。

Method: 提出AOFT策略，使用单个可学习向量生成近似正交向量，构建低秩投影矩阵，使其与预训练主干矩阵性质一致。

Result: 实验表明，AOFT在多个下游图像分类任务中表现优异，验证了其提升泛化能力的有效性。

Conclusion: AOFT通过引入近似正交性，显著提升了微调ViT的泛化能力，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by 4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on mobile devices.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

Abstract: Traditional volume visualization (VolVis) methods, like direct volume rendering, suffer from rigid transfer function designs and high computational costs. Although novel view synthesis approaches enhance rendering efficiency, they require additional learning effort for non-experts and lack support for semantic-level interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose NLI4VolVis, an interactive system that enables users to explore, query, and edit volumetric scenes using natural language. NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic segmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic components in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model architecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user intents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and declarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D editable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene editing, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system through case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility and usability in volumetric data exploration.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts. Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification, showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation, particularly in low-data regimes.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT) images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures. Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

Conclusion: fastWDM3D是一种快速且准确的健康组织修复方法，性能优于现有DDPMs方法。

Abstract: Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81 s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available at https://github.com/AliciaDurrer/fastWDM3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）的空间分辨率与光谱丰富度之间存在固有矛盾，现有方法需要不切实际的PSF校准或真实HR-HSI数据。

Method: SpectraLift利用多光谱图像的光谱响应函数（SRF）训练轻量级MLP网络，通过合成低分辨率多光谱图像（LR-MSI）作为输入，LR-HSI作为输出，优化光谱重建损失。

Result: SpectraLift在PSNR、SAM、SSIM和RMSE基准测试中优于现有方法，且收敛速度快，对空间模糊和分辨率不敏感。

Conclusion: SpectraLift提供了一种实用且高效的高光谱图像融合方法，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF) calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an $\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed, LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in the camera perspective.   Our code and the resulting dataset are available at https://github.com/richardmarcus/PBNLiDAR.

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is available at https://crystalsixone.github.io/vln_pe.github.io/.
